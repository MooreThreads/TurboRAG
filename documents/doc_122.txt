How Important is a Budget Speech?
Depends what you say in it and what you leave out. And what you do the other 365 or so days of the year. There should also be some basic coordination between ministers. See Anil Baichoo comes on TV to announce substantial increases in bus fares -- based on reasons that appear esoteric at best -- after Pravind Jugnauth has presented his budget. Not good.
Besides cost of living is a manageable quantity that can throw all kinds of politicians out of office.

Banker Says Mauritius Strong on Rhetoric
That was Mike Rees last Tuesday night at the Four Points by Sheraton. He was invited in the speaker series of the Society of Financial Analyst of Mauritius to talk on Opportunities and Risk in a Rapidly Changing Economic World. Rees also added that other countries in Africa have gotten their act together and their prospects are looking good.
The MBC and the media were there but given that the guy was challenging the bean-counting wisdom it's not surprising that one of our major papers barely mentioned that he was there.

How Bunwaree Can Be Bold In the Next Few Days
By deciding to add a few chairs on average to each Form 1 classroom in January so that the impending CPE results don't condemn several thousands kids to one more year of boredom studying a grossly ill-designed curriculum. In the process he will make some real progress on his strategic goal to make our school system more efficient.

Julian Assange Answers Questions
That was a few hours ago complimentary of The Guardian. In the meantime, Secretary of State Clinton reacted to the leaks while a Calgary Professor is now saying he's sorry about his earlier remarks that called for the assassination of Assange. The BBC expects that JA would be arrested soon on... sexual abuse charges. Here's JA talking to Chris Anderson a few months ago about why we need WikiLeaks.

PM Saying PSC is Too Slow
In filling out jobs for which funds have been earmarked so that government is proposing that the PSC delegates further recruitment and promotion authority. I have no idea at which speed the PSC has been working but I'd love the Prime Minister to tell us when exactly has the speed become unsatisfactory and whether we couldn't beef up the PSC for faster delivery.
Isn't that something the passport office could look into?

WikiLeaks Reveal Purpose of Marine Park in BIOT
And that's to make it more difficult if not impossible for Chagossians to go back home. The UK is essentially saying that fishes and bombs have rights but natives don't.

Simpler Process Makes Passport Office Really Cool
Renewing your passport is not a hernia-inducing experience anymore. Yep, you just need to fill in the 2-page form, grab two recent pics, your NIC along with the old passport and head to one of the 6 police district headquarters with the applicable fees (between 400 and 700 rupees). Head back within a week and your new passport should be ready.
If you have an emergency then you may be better off braving the awful traffic and visit the PIO headquarters. There you will be greeted by some of the most relaxed public servants who are not exactly missing the big crowds of the old days. They are instead thinking about how to further improve the service.
Shouldn't we make them run the PMO?
