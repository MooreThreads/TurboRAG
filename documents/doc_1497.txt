I’ve told tons of friends about the program…
Tori lost 35 lbs – Smoothie Shakedown
“My mom and stepdad lost a lot of weight using the Fat Flush program. My mom has tried SO many diets and this is one that seemed to really change her lifestyle habits which led to long-term change. When they were visiting last summer they invited me to do the Smoothie Shakedown with them. Without really thinking I said, ‘Yes!’
I lost 25 pounds in about 3 months! I have managed to keep it off and lose another 10 pounds, for 35 pounds altogether! When I feel my diet spiraling out of control, I rein it in with another week or two of Smoothie Shakedown (or just a mini 3-day). I was even pleased to find that I was able to maintain my current weight through Christmas!
I feel stronger and healthier in the gym. The Fat Flush Kit supplements really help keep my energy going and the Body Protein powder is BY FAR the best I’ve ever had- it makes me feel REALLY good.
Thanks so much for your great products! I’ve told tons of friends about the program… they can’t help but ask when they see how good I feel and look! I feel amazing!”
