inABLE launched the Innovation Lab computer camps to accelerate familiarity with mobile devices and employable skills training.
Over 70 students, from four schools— St. Lucy Primary School for the Blind in Meru, St. Oda Primary School for the Blind in Kisumu and Thika Primary and High Schools for the Blind for the Blind—attended the April and August 2015 school-break camps to participate in activities, such as web development, web accessibility audit and Cisco IT essentials.
This weeklong overnight computer education camp gives students and faculty more time to interact with and learn to use a variety of computer devices. Participating students, who are at different computer skill levels are encouraged to share their computer knowledge and mentor peers. An advanced student group that included both blind and visually impaired students, collaborated to design the Innovation Lab website.
The first-ever April 2015 computer-technology-education camp with a peer-to-peer computer-training focus was been generously funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, General Electric, Access Kenya LTD., Safaricom Foundation and Blackboard Inc.
