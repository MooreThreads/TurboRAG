"Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real" - Tupac Shakur (1971-1996)
Frasier is fine, but now I like more Alias (great music!!!), Prison break (Micheal is genius) or Lost, although in case of this last show I have doubts - last episodes only makes me angry and nothing more :/
24, Jericho ( I am mad that there is no second season) SG-1 (Jack is the best - I admire his sense of humour), and ER (first five seasons-I loved dr Carter sometimes ago) are also nice
meatwad666 - which Robin Hood? I like this old one with Micheal Pread.
