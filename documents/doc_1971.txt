LeBoeuf Homes, Inc. combines design and building services under one roof, working closely with clients during the design phase, much as an architect would. The built-up portfolio of the many years of projects are utilized to combine ideas with the client's ideas in producing a unique custom design that fits the clients dreams and budget.
In fact, keeping the design within the budget is a strength of our design/build firm. Throughout the entire design phase, the client is advised as to how decisions impact the final cost. Once the design and budget is established, the construction drawings are produced and with final approval of all parties, construction begins.
Throughout the development of construction the client is advised and assisted in all selections and details necessary to make each phase of the construction progress on a timely basis.
LeBoeuf Homes, Inc. takes pride in making resort ownership a pleasurable one for their clients, so service and maintenance become a priority that can extend beyond the normal warranty period. They realize their client's needs do not end upon completion of the home.
