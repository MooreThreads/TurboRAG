iMedia Agency Summit December 2013 - Overview
Media Re-Defined - What Clients Want
Today's top agencies earned that distinction by asking themselves, "How can we best serve our clients?" But with decades of insight, media modeling and AOR client relationships now being questioned, how are conscientious brand marketers evaluating their agencies and what techniques do they use to improve their relationships? To muddy the waters, new players on the client side beyond the CMO include eCommerce, CIO, and new C-level positions. How are leading agencies meeting demanding service challenges while setting realistic expectations?
This December, iMedia is dedicated to the needs of the C-Level brand marketer, catering to the client's unique business needs and infrastructure dynamics driving agency relationships. This iMedia Summit will discuss:
- Cutting the cord but not the content
- Cross-platform media measurement and attribution
- Agency re-imagined: culture, talent and technology driving media innovation
- Agency spotlight: client case studies and insights redefining client partnerships
- Media disruptors and how agencies large and small adapt
- Evolution of the media agency and addressing new.
Special Event Features include:
- iMedia Agency Awards
- The Aspen Group
- Breakout Master Tracks
