Walking and Guided tours in Mallorca are very popular and there is a variety of different options: the popular free tours, night tours, bike tours, Segway tours… Here is a list of suggestions:
Palma is the most visited city in Mallorca. We offer a selection of walking tours either shared or private tours You can opt for the classical route in the old town, the express tour visiting the old town and Cathedral or a theme orientated tour such as a food walking tour or the Jewish quarter.
Our company is based in the North area of the island, and the historical old town of Alcudia is one of the most popular places there. This is the reason why we offer several interesting walking tours. The classic tour covers the old town area with its main sights. Our new walking tour is a combination of the old town, the market and the coast with a local guide and a picnic with Mallorcan products.
In Alcudia we also have a selection of guided bike tours that will take you off the beaten track, through the countryside that feels like a million miles from the tourist resort right next door. We have a brand new bike tour to the exclusive cove of Es Coll Baix. These tours are an amazing way to discover Mallorca's lesser accessible areas.
For those who do not walk much, it is an interesting suggestion to make a guided route by Segway or bike. With the help of a local guide you can get to know Palma's main attractions in an entertaining way. Mallorca is with a private tour. These are guided tours where the client decides what he wants to visit, the duration, the places of interest… If you are interested on this option, send us an email with your idea, and we will send a proposal.
