SPIRIT CONSTRUCTION
State of the art multiple boiler machine. Developed with the demands of very high output
espresso bars in mind: equipped with well-considered ergonomics: an efficient high precision tool
with enormous capacity.
Construction
Separate boilers
The Spirit is equipped with multiple boilers: one large steam boiler to produce hot water and steam, one boiler per group to heat water to brew coffee. Each boiler has its own electronic temperature controller system, heating element and safety devices, offering extremely precise temperature stability. Huge capacity is secured by the large steam boiler, over-rated heating elements in all boilers, double pumps and heat-exchangers inside the steam boiler, pre-heating the brew water for the large, dedicated coffee boilers.
Steam boiler
The rear steam boiler has a total capacity of 10,5ltr (Duette) / 19.5ltr. Triplette. An electronic temperature controller gets its information through a precise and fast reacting probe, located in the steam and activates the heating element via 3 solid state relays..
Coffee water boiler with group temperature-neutral material. As this block remains cool, the fats and oils in the coffee do not bake on, effectively keeping it clean for a long time. This block consists of two pieces offering a nicely divided dispersion of the water.. This membrane provides a very even dispersion of the water during extraction. It also strongly filters the water sucked up when the pressure is discharged at the end of the shot. This again ensures a cleaner inside of the group.
Infusion
The importance of pre-infusion procedure also locks in the fines, preventing them from travelling downwards and clogging the filter.
Even more importantly however, pre-infusion allows a slow. All the smaller coffee particles together offer a larger surface making it easier to wash out the oils and fats.
When the brew process is started by moving the lever and slowly re-pressurizes the complete coffee boiler system till full 9 bar extraction pressure. This build-up of pressure is steady and slow, ensuring the integrity of the puck remains unaltered..
A Spirit standard comes with two pumps. One for the coffee system, the other for filling the steam boiler and supplying cold water to add at the hot water spout. This way both functions can be used without fear of some loss of pressure. Steam boiler will be filled, even when for several hours on end at least one group is being used, as happens in truly busy bars.
As an option one pump per group is offered, to ensure no loss of extraction pressure whatsoever between the groups.. Also,activates.
Features
• Standard equipped with 2 external pumps. One to extract coffee, one to re-fill the steam boiler and to add some cold water to the hot water spout. This to ensure the steam boiler will be re-filled ••without affecting the coffee extraction, even during very busy times when for hours on end one or more groups are activated. To ensure the hot water supply is always at the correct same ••temperature, the re-fill of the steam boiler is deactivated during hot water supply.
• Shot timers, installed in full view, right above each group.
• Illuminated rear panel, optionally with printed custom logo.
• Intuitive operation by levers. Group levers offer 2 automatic shot volumes per group. These can also be programmed at endless, to offer on-off operation.
• Self-bleeding groups.
• Auto-back-flush program, all groups pressurize and discharge simultaneously 8 times.
• One separate PID temperature controller for each boiler, display in full easy view.
• Energy saving Eco mode on each temperature controller, for nights and/or weekends.
• Energy saving hot water system. Some cold is added to the hot water, so less heated water is needed. This mix provides a steady, non-spattering stream with the correct temperature to prepare Americanos. The hot water is controlled by a quick to adjust timer.
• Choice of touch pad to activate the group, offering 4 automatic volumes plus continuous, or the Bastone lever, offering 2 automatic volumes plus continuous. The touch pad can easily
be swapped for a Bastone bracket, or vice versa, also later.
• Drip tray quickly adjustable in height, optionally a raised tray for espresso cups is available.
• Stainless steel filter holders with KvdW POM handles.
• Slow automatic infusion process, with step less build of pressure to full extraction mode. This allows a finer grind, creating more surface, so a higher yield in the cup, less chance on channelling, preventing fines to travel down.
• Wide choice in filter baskets, both sizes as types.
• Rubber group gaskets remain flexible forever, do not become hard or brittle.
• Membrane type group screen, very nice dispersion, less coffee sucked up by discharge of pressure at end of extraction. Remains clean longer.
• Heat neutral polymer dispersion block, no loss of heat, no baking on of oils and fats, remains clean longer.
• Heavily protected heating element (extra safety level probe, cut-out switch with feeler against element in water, machine shuts down when any of the solenoid valves remains open for longer than 120 seconds).
• Entire frame in stainless steel only, powder coated in crackle black, optionally bare.
• Large steam boiler capacity:10.5ltr. with Duette, 19.5ltr. for the Triplette.
• Large coffee boiler capacity, total of 2.1ltr. each.
• Elevated position of body, easy cleaning of bar surface, yet low enough to allow comfortable barista-customer contact.
The Spirit was built with a single goal in mind: A machine that delivers extreme precision no matter what you throw at it. Combining the hyper-precise qualities of the Speedster with an extreme power does exactly that, And more.
