A survey of manufacturing activity in the New York state area showed its largest-ever drop into negative territory in June. The Empire State manufacturing index plummeted 26.4 points to negative 8.6 in June, a record decline. Economists had expected a reading of positive 10, according to a survey by Econoday.

Separately, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative is holding seven days of public hearings on the Trump administration’s proposal to raise a 25% levy on $300 billion of Chinese exports, including consumer goods such as mobile phones and laptops.

Ian Winer, an advisory board member of Drexel Hamilton, suggested that the Fed may cut rates sooner and more aggressively than expected due to pressure from President Trump.
“I am pretty sure the brow beating led to the massive about face in February from hawkish to dovish. I also don’t see how his comments and complaints over both social media and live interviews have no effect on the mindset of [Jerome] Powell,” he said. “I think as we get closer to the election we will hear more of the same..
