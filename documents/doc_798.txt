Hi, I'll introduce myself before I ask you: I'm ManelGris, a Catalan guitarist/singer, using an old POD XT live. I invite you to hear some recordings made with it at.
I start this discussion because in one of my songs I use an octave preset like "octave bend" or "Whammy octave up". The fact is that I play half of the song without the bend stomp, and when it comes to use it, I get detuned half a tone, so I can't synchronize myself with the rest of the band (for instance, we play in D and I find myself sounding at D#).
Can anyone give me a tip (edition, maybe making a preset from zero or anything else) to avoid it?
Many thanks in advance!

Sounds like you may need to calibrate your pedal.

Hi, Mr_Arkadin, I've tried to calibrate my pedal, but when iI got to the step 4 it didn't happen what i't was supposed to. No switch clicked, and no light turned on.
However, I finished the process to see if really happened something, but when I powered my POD everything was even worst than before with those presets: when pressing the Stomp pedal
seems that my guitar fell from the attic or I played within an owen: it sounds completely detuned, string by string.
Hummm... What to do?

Sounds like the pedal part may be faulty.
Make sure you really put your weight into the pedal to make it click when calibrating.
If you still have no joy the two options are to try and fix it yourself (the pedal may just need cleaning - but I do not know how the Live works internally so do not know how easy of difficult this is), or to send it to your local Line 6 service centre:">">
