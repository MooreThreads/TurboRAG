I'm sorry the pictures are so dark....."someone" (I'm not naming names) has messed with my camera!
***NOTE: There is no added salt in this recipe.....I LOVE salt, and I even found there is SO much flavor I didn't need to add it.
Step 1: Recipe
.5 C Mint
.5C Fresh Lemon Juice (the juice of about 2 large lemons)
5 Garlic Cloves
1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
2 Teaspoons Lemon Pepper (I used Mrs. Dash)
.5 C Chicken Broth (or use half dry white wine, and half chicken broth
Step 2: Method
Wash the mint if yours came from outside like mine does, then pull just the leaves from the stem.
Put the mint, garlic, lemon juice, lemon pepper, and olive oil into a food processor, and process it until everything is well mixed.....I like mine pretty smooth.
Put the chicken chunks into a zipper bag, and dump in the mint mixture. Squish it all around and refrigerate for about 2 hours.
***NOTE: Do not madinate chicken too long with this much lemon (or any other acid) or it will make the texture mushy.
Step 3: Assemble, & Cook
Thread the chicken cubes onto skewers. Place on a piece of foil large enough to hold all the skewers.
At this point you can either cook on the outdoor grill, or broil in the oven. Either way cook about 7 minutes without disturbing, then turn and cook another 3-4 minutes.
I like these flexible skewers. I think they're called Fire Wires
I'm sorry the POINT (or period) didn't show up better
so it would be:
one half cup of mint
one half cup lemon juice
one half cup chicken broth
I hope this helps....it's really a good recipe
