Glitra Scarf
. Taking further inspiration from the mountainous peaks, a geometric short-row stitch pattern is knit on each tip of the rectangular scarf.
The remaining length is worked in a knit and purl stripe formation, causing the fabric to undulate like crisp waves. The scarf is worked from each end in two pieces and joined at the center using the Kitchener stitch.
