NHL '08-'09 Season Preview: Power RankingsOctober 4, 2008
Mark Jones' 2008-2009 NHL Season Preview
Power Rankings (by conference):
Eastern Conference
1. Montreal Canadiens*
2. Washington Capitals*
3. Pittsburgh Penguins*
4. Philadelphia Flyers
5. New York Rangers
6. New Jersey Devils
7. Carolina Hurricanes
8. Florida Panthers
Some question the capability of the Hurricanes and Panthers, two young, Southeast Division teams. Yet, both have the capabilities. The Panthers, especially, have improved over the offseason. Though, the Washington Capitals are easily the best team in the Southeast Division.
Western Conference
1. Detroit Red Wings*
2. San Jose Sharks*
3. Anaheim Ducks
4. Calgary Flames*
5. Dallas Stars
6. Chicago Blackhawks
7. Minnesota Wild
8. Colorado Avalanche
The eighth spot will be hotly contested by the Canucks, Avalanche, Oilers, Coyotes, and Predators. With the Pacific Division looking so good, the Coyotes will have a hard time getting the final spot with such a difficult schedule.
The Oilers and Canucks just can't seem to finish. And, the Predators can't seem to get enough home advantage from some lousy Nashville fans. The Red Wings, once again, look like the Western Conference team to beat. Additionally, the San Jose Sharks are becoming an extremely talented team.
