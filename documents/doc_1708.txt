Defense and Protection Spell
* 4 or more rail road spikes
* Half yard of red cloth
* 4 or more containers of Red Devil Lye
* 1 large bottle of Whiskey or Rum
* Tobacco
* Fiery Wall of Protection Incense
* 4 or more Sixth Pentacles of Mars from the Key of Solomon or you may choose to use a different protection talisman.
* Glue
* John the Conqueror Root Chips
* Devil?s Dung
* Red Pepper
This defense and protection ritual will be deployed at the four corners of your house. A person living in an apartment or condo can improvise by setting potted plants in the four perimeter corners of their dwelling. Perform during the hours of Mars if possible.
Soak the rail road spikes overnight in whiskey or rum; this will clean and feed the iron. Take spikes from rum and allow to air dry.
Cut the red cloth into 6 inch strips about one inch wide. If you only have four spikes, you will only need four strips of cloth. Set the strips aside.
Print out the talismans using the appropriate color ink. For the Sixth Pentacle of Mars, red is the appropriate color. Glue one talisman to each railroad spike ? see my photo for an example. As you prepare your spikes, pray your prayer of protection such as the 27th Psalms or a protection mantra/chant associated with the Deity or Loa you work with.
Next tie a strip of red cloth around each railroad spike directly under the head of the spike. Now you will smoke the spikes in the Fiery Wall of Protection incense. Add some tobacco to heighten the effect. As you wave each spike through the smoke of the incense, continue repeating your prayers and incantations. See the energy of your enemies repelled by a giant invisible force field surrounding your residence. Visualize your spiritual helpers forming an impenetrable perimeter of protection. You may wish to add red pepper or High John the Conqueror Root Chips to the Fiery Wall of Protection. You can also substitute Devils Dung for the High John or use the Devil?s Dung alone as incense. All are effective alone or combined for protection work. The next step is optional but effective. Prick your finger to draw blood and place a drop of your blood on each spike. You may be led to place the blood on the talisman too. If pricking your finger is out of the question, dress the spikes with a little of your urine.
Now it is time to put your protection in place. Dig a hole at the four corners of your house and place a container of Red Devil Lye with the Devil facing outward in the hole. Cover the hole and drive the railroad spike into the ground next to the hole. The head of the spikes should be flush with the ground and hopefully you will be able to locate it each month to feed the spike a shot glass of rum or whiskey mixed with some of your urine. After you drive the railroad spike into the ground, pour a shot glass of whiskey on it and whisper your prayer, Psalm, incantation or invocation. Once a month during the Full Moon or New Moon feed the spikes in this manner or as frequently as you are led.
As you can see, this protection spell incorporates multiple traditions such as Solomonic magick, Hoodoo, Vodoun, Palo, Santeria and astrological magick. Spiritual/magical traditions can be used effectively by observing the simple rule of the Doctrine of Signatures and the Law of Correspondence. In this defense and protection spell each component complements the other and combines to strengthen the results of the spell. One word of caution: when working with spirit entities of different traditions make sure they will get along or the spell may back fire or not work at all.
