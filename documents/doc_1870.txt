When you drive away from one of our dealerships in your newly bought used car, you’ll be protected by our 30 days Cars2 warranty which covers your car against a number of potential mechanical failures that occur from time-to-time simply as a result of modern day vehicles having many working parts that are fallible.
An ‘Extended Warranty’ does exactly what it is says on the tin, it extends the period of your warranty from 30 days to a specified time period, for example 2 years. This means the cost of any defects and repairs will be paid for by the policy provider, not you the customer.
At Cars2 we can tailor a warranty product to the value of car you own and the length of additional cover you need. All of our products are 5-star Defaqto rated, meaning you’ll get the best possible level of cover and service.
For more information, speak to one of our sales representatives each of who are each trained to advise on such products.
