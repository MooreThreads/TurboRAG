Random but I could see Henderson getting traded to the Wolves for Williams . That would be decent for both sides . Henderson in the backcourt with Rubio could help his game alot .

henderson could not even play well when his team was the worst in the league, he sucks. why does anyone want him

No Evans , it like he doesn't care to work on his jumpshot at all
Until Henderson proves this year's 3P% isn't a fluke, I don't want him.
The part of getting the 'other guy' in the backcourt with Rose, I'm gonna leave up to the Bulls FO to figure that out, idk everyone's contract situations nor do I have the time to think about it and look it up and keep up to date with all that tbh I'll admit, got other things going on much more important. I threw a few names out there that I think you took literally. But I'm not saying I wouldn't like the idea of them being on the Bulls but we'll see how things play out.
Gordon was considered a very very good player who can be an all star and was spoken highly of the first few years, only knock was injuries so hence he got a max or near max offer.
Batum also is another guy who is highly regarded around the league for his career so hence he got a good offer for himself.
Stuckey was one of the main guys that Detroit wanted to keep and thus it showed by them ridding of Billups essentially. He was going to be part of their core.
Evans as of right now, the same can't be said for I think.
But just want to remind everyone, I'm just putting a name out there (even tho I wouldn't mind Evans personally).
