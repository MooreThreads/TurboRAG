Kids love this truck, they have hours of fun with it. If it can hold up to them, it can withstand most children.

Gave this to my three year old grandson for Xmas and he loves it. My son was amazed at all the extras it had. This is a great wooden toy train.

The remote could never be used, so the toy was worthless.

Bought this for a friends baby. They love that it plush and not wooden if it ever tips over with the baby on board!

It wasn't the latest one (the year started at 2013) but at the price, it was a good buy and will prove a good way to teach organizational skills.

I have two grandsons age 2 and 4. They play with this toy for hours together and they don't get in each other's way. There is so much here to keep them both busy. It is a wonderful toy, a dollhouse for boys!

KIDS ENJOYED THIS TOY. GOT A KICK OF THEIR DIFFERENT SOUNDS OF THEIR VOICES. LOTS OF SMILES AND GIGGLES. WORTH THE PRICE!

I bought this for my four years old nephew and he loves it. He has not had it for very long, so I cannot commit on the life of the product.

Bought this for my 6 year old's birthday. My husband had no problem assembling it. My son absolutely adores it. Nice storage area behind the seat for all his gear. Love it!

My grandson is three. This bike will go forever on a charge which is great because he even rides it to the bathroom. This is the BEST TOY we have ever bought!!!!!!! Thank you Overstock, Barry

Nice Christmas train, but, all trains should have a whistle. Smoke from the stack and functioning light are great, but no whistle.
