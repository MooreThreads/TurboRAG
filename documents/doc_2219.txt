East Lae`apuki Shatter Ring (1.0 MB)
October 16 , 2006 06:20:23 to 08:00:22
(2 hours 19 minutes and 59 seconds -- 1 frame per minute)
The feature seen here is called a shatter ring. It is a circular rampart of broken rock that forms over a lava tube when lava pressure in the tube repeatedly exceeds the strength of the overlying rock. Repeated flexing of the lava-tube roof breaks the rock around the edges of the mobile area. This shatter ring was active from late September to mid-October 2006, and, in this sequence, was about 55 m long and and 2.5 m high. The center of the shatter ring, which is not visible here, was about a meter lower than the lava surface outside the shatter ring. Thus, the center of the shatter ring uplifted about 5 meters during this event. Lava emerging from the base of the shatter ring is evidence of the overpressurization of the lava tube.
