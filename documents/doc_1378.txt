Perfect fitting screen guard for Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos I9082As usual, prompt delivery from flipkart. As for the screen guard, it perfectly fits my Samsung Galaxy Grand Duos I9082. Clear set of instructions to apply the screen guard is also included. Highly recommended for a classy device.

pathetic productUsing it for last 2 weeks ... this is a finger print magnate ... will drastically reduce the touch quality of your device ... Also the product which i received had a hole punched through it by a stapler, may be by the delivery guy or the flipkart people back at their warehouse while packing it !!!

Good one to protect your Grand!A decent Screen guard. Protects the Screen well and doesn't create any problems with the touch. A little high on cash though. Used it for 6 months now.. Will have to get a new one as I keep dropping my phone and got some scratches on it :(

Good Product !Fitted perfectoo with my grand & as they said they were no bubbles (bubble free) & Smudge free. I really loved this as this was totally unlike from the other products which are cheap & make ur mobile worn-out.
