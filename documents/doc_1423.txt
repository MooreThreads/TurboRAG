Fadi Murr and his team of stylists at Gemi Hair are going all out on Saturday, Sept. 14 for a fundraiser benefiting the Victoria SPCA.
The shop, at 1329 Cook St., will be closed for regular business, with all hairstyling on the day offered by donation.
The corner will be hopping with a DJ churning out tunes, chicken and beef kebabs and specialty coffees available for purchase and a dog wash ongoing. All proceeds from the day go to the cause.
Industry professionals will talk about haircare products and samples will be available. Things get going around 11 a.m. and run until about 4 p.m., but the shop will stay open until 7 p.m.
Pharmacy offers value added
Longtime Victoria natives and lifelong friends Don Swainson and Jonathan Cox have teamed up to open Vital Health Pharmacy at 1825 Fort St. The outlet not only provides traditional prescription services, it has an onsite intravenous and IV infusion clinic, where clients receive injection medications and be monitored by nurses from Bayshore Home Health, a partner in the operation.

As part of its ninth National Family Dinner Night, the company is also asking people to submit favourite recipes made with M&M products for a chance to win prizes.
