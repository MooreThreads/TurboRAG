It is no a templating system (although it has "spycelambdas" and integrate with other real template systems like Cheetah).

It is not only API (like PEAR or phpLib for PHP). ADOdb has several nice features beyound the basic API abstraction. Eg. it has real caching system for results extracted from databases. >The Python equivalent would then be the Python Database API >specification, for which there are many implementations for the popular >and less popular databases. See They are nice, but they are no such powerfull like ADOdb. I found only this:. >To be honest, I wouldn't how to "cache SQL queries". How would you know >you're not out of sync with the backend database? I can set up timeout of every query (eg. the cache will be refreshed every hour, or a day, or a week). I can also refresh it manually whetever I want. It works fine and for heavy sql queries it is very usefull.
