You will receive an email within 48 hrs that includes your contract (which must be signed before getting access to the building) as well as information pertinent to your event.
I want to pay the rest of my balance. What are the options?
The remaining balance is paid through Cashapp $PoshVenue. Include your name & date of your event.
Can I tour the venue before booking?
We are limiting in-person tours to those who have booked. Our venue is completely viewable from the outside, so there are no surprises. Drive by anytime to take a look (if there is an event, please be respectful and do not interfere). In addition, there are videos & pictures on Fb, Instagram, and here on the website.
What time can I enter the building to begin the set-up?
You can enter the building at the time you booked. For example, if you booked 9-3pm, you can enter at 9am. If you need additional time for set up, you may purchase extra time at a rate of $100/hr. You may not come in the morning to set-up for an evening event.
Can I have alcohol at the venue?
Yes, you are allowed to serve alcohol to your guests. However, you may not sell alcohol or have a cash bar. You may not charge attendance to an event where alcohol is served.
