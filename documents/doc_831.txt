I took the opportunity of an Anything Goes challenge to decorate one more of the boxes I have recycled to house my completed cards in. This one is for the Autumn themed cards:
I would like to enter my box into these challenges:
QKR Stampede - Anything Goes
I have used a box that originally contained Hot Chocolate sachets. I painted the box with gesso and then acrylic paint. I stencilled a pattern onto the box using Distress Ink - Picket Fence and a Tim Holtz stencil. I also added some white dots using a white pen to two of the corners. The image is from QKR Stampede and is coloured with copic markers. I cut off one of the leaves and then glued it separately to avoid too much white space around the image.
Your image is so cute - and a clever way to organize your cards. Thanks for entering the Anything Goes challenge this week at QKR Stampede. Dorothy S, DT member
