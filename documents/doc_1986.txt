Test Questions are Figure Eight’s quality control mechanism within jobs. By providing the answers to a small percentage of rows, you can tell how accurately a contributors is working and will automatically remove any who do not meet your accuracy threshold. This article covers the interface used to create Test Questions. If you've already created test question in your job, they will appear in a list under 'Quality' tab from the top bar. Here, you can review all of your Test Questions. For more information on reviewing Test Questions, please see the Review Test Questions article.

Note: You will not be able to create any Test Questions if you don’t have any data. Surveys, for example, don’t require any data, therefore a message will appear when you try to create Test Questions:

The following options are for creating and editing Test Questions, which become available after you select “Create Test Questions” if there are no Test Questions in your job, or “Create More” if there are existing Test Questions in your job.
Test Question Creation
The Test Question creation page will closely resemble the interface you created in the 'Design' step with 2 exceptions:
- 1. radio / drop down inputs will be replaced with checkboxes to allow multiple correct answers
- 2. A text box area will populate under each question so you can provide a reason explaining why your answer is correct.
Selecting 'Save' will create a copy of the row and mark it as a Test Question, containing your answers and reasons.
