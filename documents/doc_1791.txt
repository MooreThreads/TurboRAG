Central will continue to celebrate the anniversary with events and initiatives throughout the 2017-18 academic year. These include:
- 125 Years through 125 Voices, an exhibit by the Clarke Historical Library, opened in September.
- The Clarke Historical Library also launched an online timeline featuring milestones in CMU’s history.
- A special homecoming celebration October 14.
- A community speaker series featuring CMU faculty will begin in the spring 2018 semester.
A webpage about the anniversary, highlighting CMU’s proud past and promising future, will be updated throughout the year.
