Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant
The Energy Alliance story is one of effective cross-jurisdictional collaboration to achieve larger community goals. In 2009, the organization leveraged an initial investment from the Greater Cincinnati Foundation to bring together energy efficiency funding as part of the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant (EECBG) program.
The following jurisdictions were key partners in this effort:
- Hamilton County
- City of Cincinnati
- Boone County
- City of Florence
- Kenton County
- City of Covington
- Campbell County
Early support from these regional governments allowed the Energy Alliance to build a program that guides residents through the energy improvement process, provides financing solutions to make investments more affordable, and creates jobs for a growing energy efficiency sector.
Better Buildings Neighborhood Program
In April 2010, the Energy Alliance was one of just twenty-five organizations nationwide awarded a competitive Better Buildings Grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.
The Better Buildings Neighborhood Program was developed to:
- Retrofit 150,000 buildings
- Create 30,000 jobs
- Save consumers $65 million in energy costs
The $17 million grant award helped the Energy Alliance to rapidly expand its offerings to local building owners and to develop an array of programs to generate energy savings. The Better Buildings partnership sparked a new energy efficiency industry in our region.
Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program
In 2011, the Energy Alliance became an officially recognized sponsor of the Home Performance with ENERGY STAR program developed by the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
The ENERGY STAR brand is recognized by 84 percent of Americans, and its home performance program now has over fifty sponsors nationally. This partnership bolsters the success and credibility of the residential program.
