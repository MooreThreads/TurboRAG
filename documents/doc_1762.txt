04 Mar Veterinary Neurology Seminar in Bellingham
We would like to thank the many veterinarians from the Bellingham area who attended our neurology seminar on Wednesday February 25th. Dr. Gordon spoke about seizure activity in companion animals as well as about intervertebral disc disease.
This continuing education seminar was organized by the Tri-County Veterinary Medical Association and took place at Bellingham Technical College. The collegeâ€™s culinary department prepared a delicious buffet for guests which kept us going back for more!
Dr. Gordon feels that neurology might not be as exciting for everyone as it is for himself but the humorous side of him makes up for it in a big way. Dr. Gordon thoroughly enjoyed engaging with his audience until late that evening.
As we are only about 20 minutes from the border, we often see patients from Washington State that require specialty services offered by BBVSH. It was a great pleasure for Dr. Gordon to be able to meet some of the referring veterinarians from just across the line.
