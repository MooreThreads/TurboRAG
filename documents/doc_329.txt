PSY’s “Gangnam Style” T-Shirt Sold on German Online Store
PSY’s “Gangnam Style” took the U.S. by storm last week, and now, it’s reached a German online shopping mall as well.
Recently, an online t-shirt store, “Spreadshirt,” revealed a new product inspired by PSY’s “Gangnam Style.” The shirt comes with a picture of PSY’s signature “horse dance,” and lines that say, “Keep Calm and Gangnam Style.” The “Keep Calm” design is one of “Spreadshirt’s” most popular items, and the PSY’s edition is the latest one to come from the highly successful online store.
It’s unclear how many copies of the PSY’s shirt have sold out so far, but Korean press and netizens are taking it as a reflection of how popular and viral “Gangnam Style” has gone over the past week.
Netizens commented, “’Gangnam Style’ is daebak,” “I need to order that shirt now,” and “I wonder who designed that.”
With over 300 employees, the Geremany-based “Spreadshirt” is one of the fastest growing and largest online t-shirt retailers. It is expected to reach $100 million in sales this year.
