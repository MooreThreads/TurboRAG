Fawad Chaudhry, Federal Minister for Information & Broadcasting, confirmed that overseas Pakistanis can bring their personal phones with them without having to pay taxes, however, they will be required to pay customs for additional phones.

Meanwhile, Hammad Azhar, State Minister for Revenue, has also made it further clear by publishing a series of tweets mentioning that Overseas Pakistanis can also bring their personal phone to the country without any need of paying regulatory taxes. However, any additional phones that they will be carrying will need to be cleared from the Customs first.

Mobile Phones’ Pricing and Customs Duty in Pakistan
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has published a list of mobile phones covering 186 models released since 2016 with their corresponding prices and Duty rates. Pakistan Customs has also issued a valuation ruling for determination of values so that cell phones can be cleared in a speedy manner.
It is worth mentioning that the PTA has started blocking cell phones with unauthorized IMEI numbers from December 1, 2018, but those phones which entered Pakistan without proper customs clearance have been allowed to be cleared from PTA after payment of duties and taxes.
