Does anyone remember the Miss L Fire Betty shoe from our Summer collection? Probably not as it simply flew off the shelves! Well, for those of you who missed out, Lupita is Autumn/Winter's answer to Betty.
In soft velvety suede, we've chosen two versatile and warming Winter colours to compliment your look, whether you've opted for tights, stockings or jeans. The chocolate has berry undertones, and looks fabulous with warm colours; try with the brown Eve dressand a matching beret for effortless Autumn chic. The green, a subtle sage, is understated and will compliment blacks and browns. Why not match it with your favourite Ashley dressand a Salina Cardigan?
As regular stockists of Miss L Fire shoes, we can vouch for their quality and comfort and Lupita is no exception. The detailing is exquisite, with cute little triangle cut-outs and low cut, asymmetric detailing on the upper- how can you go wrong?
We've found that Lupita has a standard fit, so go for the size you normally would. However, as it's a court shoe, with no straps or fastenings, if you are between sizes, go for the smaller of the two to prevent any slippage.
The 3 inch heel is comfortable and extremely manageable, due to its width, so would be a suitable choice for heel novices and aficionados alike.
p.s. there is padding in the arch! These really are shoes designed for happy »
