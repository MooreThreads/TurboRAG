Update: Sleet N & W may slide south
Just wet roads in immediate metro region
* Saturday sun, Sunday rain: Full Forecast into next week *
* Radar, temps & more: Weather Wall | Traffic | Get There *
Another batch of mixed precipitation has developed over the region as an upper level disturbance pivots through the region. Over much of the immediate metro area (inside the beltway), the precipitation is in the form of rain. As you head north and west outside the beltway, the rain mixes with and gradually changes to sleet. Some snow has also been reported around Frederick county in Maryland.
Through mid-afternoon, light precipitation will continue. The precipitation type forecast remains challenging, but where it's sleeting now precipitation may mix with or change to snow. Places getting rain may experience a changeover to sleet (with just a slight chance of some snow mixing in) before the precipitation tapers off. With temperatures holding in the mid-to-upper 30s in the immediate metro region, only wet roads are expected (with just a 30% chance of a coating of sleet or snow, mainly on grassy areas). North and west of the beltway, a light slushy accumulation of sleet and a little snow is possible with amounts increasing the further north and west you go.
See our full forecast through the weekend into next week.

I'm not in the heaviest band but it looks like some heavier stuff is headed south in my direction. Already nasty.

Last couple of frames on the radar loop seem to show the upper level disturbance weakening. As predicted, looks like it may be outta here early this afternoon.

It is sleeting here near Fair Oaks Mall. I am not sure why they dropped the advisory in Fairfax.

@barbnc
The Winter Weather Advisory was never in effect for Fairfax County, as surface temps there are expected to stay too warm for any frozen precip to cause much trouble.

Rain/sleet/snow grossness falling in McLean as of right before noon. I hate this kind of winter storm more than anything. At least we have a nice day tomorrow to look forward to after all this clears out?

Lol, so I leave my house in Reston, with no rain at 7:30AM. I run into rain near Dranesville, then it's wet in Sterling (At the DMV), but not raining. I spend forever there, only to find out that I need to hit up another place for written documentation (To renew my license), and as I walk and drive between places, I go from completely dry conditions, to being inundated in rain, to being pelted with sleet (All within an hour). Then I run into a downpour just down the street from my home (While at a business), but when I finally make it back to the house this afternoon, it's all dry just as it started out when I left there this morning lol.

Mix of everything this morning in Darnestown, ground was getting white. Sleeting and snowing pretty hard when I left for work, but it stopped abruptly just west of Olney. Sun is peeking out now where I work in Columbia.

The Sterling radar makes it look like you guys are going to wash away or something, it looks like almost solid red from Stafford to Rockville. What's going on up there? Is that all extremely heavy rain or is the radar just detecting sleet and making it look worse than it is?
BTW -- It's going to be 70 degrees and sunny down here today. =P
