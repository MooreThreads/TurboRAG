Fuzzy's Ultra Premium Vodka
The Myth, The Man, The Golf Legend, Fuzzy Zoeller is known around the world for his golfing success, charismatic character and outgoing personality! His credits include winning ten times on the PGA Tour, including the 1979 Masters and 1984 U.S. Open along with the 1985 and 1986 Skins Game, just to name just a few.
Fuzzyâ€™s commitment to golf goes beyond playing the game, as he is also well known for his golf course design, and designing nineteen courses, 3 of which host PGA Tour events. Fuzzy also owns two golf courses located in Southern Indiana, Covered Bridge Golf Club and Champions Pointe Golf Club, he makes countless special appearances and has attended numerous corporate golf events.
In addition to his golf victories, golf course design, and special aapperances, Fuzzy has also received several awards for his sportsmanship and charitable work through his Fuzzyâ€™s Charities for Kids, raising nearly $2,000,000 over the years.
Superior Taste and Gluten Free
Fuzzy Zoeller knows what victory tastes like and he wants to share that with you! Fuzzy's Ultra Premium Vodka sports an award winning taste, that is truly distinctive, especially after he spent nearly four years creating a something that not only satisfied, but exceeded his tastes and preferences. Distilled five times from corn, and with the addition of Cascade Mountain spring water, this blend creates a smooth crisp finish, that is also Gluten Free.
Theoretically, distillation of any alcoholic beverage, if done properly, should remove all the gluten. However, not all makers of alcoholic beverages distill enough times to purify their beverages completely, and some add in a little of the grain "mash" (which can contain gluten) following distillation to improve color and flavor. You never have to worry about this with Fuzzy's Ultra Premium Vodka because again, it is made from corn.
The vodka itself is clear and very clean, with mild aromas having the faintest hint of citrus. It's clean and pure, with a delicate and delicious flavor. Perfect for making an awesome martini!
Testing & Awards
Over the past couple of years, Fuzzy has personally conducted numerous blind taste tests with family, friends and golf fans at professional tournaments, pitting his vodka against every "heavy hitter" in the vodka category. He feels the key factor is the smoothness, and smoothness is what his vodka provides.
States Fuzzy, "I poured several different samples of various brands in a blind tasting. Everyone chose Fuzzy's Ultra Premium Vodka over the other brands. I knew I liked it, but that confirmed everything when they choose it as well. I knew we had a winner."
