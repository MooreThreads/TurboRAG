WowGamerBabe: omg, that is stunning!!!!!!!! Where did you get it??
Itâ€™s really pretty! I looks like a mystic topaz to me. I love the claw prongs too!
WowGamerBabe: wow. Can i have one? That is stunning!!
FutureDrAtkins: Thought it was a mystic as wellâ€¦
What ever it is , itâ€™s stunning !(:
prettyinpink11: I got it online through Kayâ€™s Outlet. It costâ€™s $99 dollars, but I was able to get a $25 dollar coupon for signing up for email promotions. So in the end it was about $75 dollars with free shipping.
Thanks everyone I am quite pleased with it. I too thought green topaz?? But whatever they want to call it, itâ€™s beautiful.
wow! Beautiful and a great deal too! I thought it was much more expensive then that! Good find!
Looks like a mystic topaz, and itâ€™s a gorgeous stone and setting! Great find!
Wow gorgeous rhr!!!
Woweeeeeee I seriously love it. Itâ€™s stunning!!!
Thank you everyone ðŸ™‚ Once you all mentioned that the stone is a Mystic Topaz I began to look around and it is! I just donâ€™t know why they would list it as a Green Topaz! So now I know what the correct name to the stone is I will edit my post. Thanks for the input ðŸ™‚
