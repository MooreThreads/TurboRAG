FYI:I consume this many packs of Splenda a week!
I'm a huge coffee fan. I drink about 3 cups aday. I take my coffee with a little bit of half andhalf and 2 packets of Splenda. That's 6 packets of Splenda a day. So, I wonder if thisstuff is really safe? I'm now hearing that evidence is accumulating which suggests the chemical sweetenersucralose (Splenda) may be harmful (andmay cause organ damage). Perhaps I should just stick to sugar.
Speaking about "zero sugar", RobNicholson just posted a very impressive entry on the ProjectZero blog, describing howto run SugarCRM Community Edition on Project Zero. Rob and team have continued to evolve Project Zero's PHP support andrunning SugarCRM on Zero is a milestone worth noting. (In fact, Robwill be demo'ing it at IMPACT2008 next week).
I have blogged about our PHPstrategy in the past. I've talked about how runningclassic PHP application atop Project Zero was one of our goals (likePHPBB). SugarCRMis arguably the most important, PHP-based, business applicationavailable today. Sugar is a very popular, fullfunction CRM application that has a vibrant community of users behindit. With Sugar now running on the Zero platform, things canreally get interesting. Sugar extensions can be written onZero, using our PHP support. Extensions should also be possiblein Groovy and Java (given Zero/PHP runs on a JVM) and developers caneven use the new ProjectZero Web IDE to do so.
As Project Zero continues to evolve, applications like Sugar will beable to utilize aspects of the Zero run-time environment, like featuresI described as "theNew Reality Run-time". Similarly, the Zero management environment will be able to support scaling andclustering of classic PHP applications like Sugar.
I think this is just the tip of the Sugar cube, so tospeak. So, maybe I can get my sugar fix after all,without using any of those potentially harmful substitutes.
