Breakfast was nice.
Room smelled slightly of smoke.!
I liked the location and breakfast. The staff was nice. I liked having the coffee maker in the room.
I could not request two beds for two people without getting charged. I had to sleep with my mother in a queen bed. I'm an adult not a child. The heating system. The biggest disappointed; I left some small items, was charged $15 to have them mailed.
It was close to the event that I was attending
There was not a microwave or refrigeration in the room. The room was very small
The price. Shuttle service. On sight restaurant.
Additional charge for shuttle service. Long wait to get back to hotel.
Having a restaurant attached was very convenient.
Layout is a little confusing- even the staff sent us the wrong way.
We stayed for our anniversary. The size of the room was great as well as the convenience of having the casino connected.
Cost was a little higher and would have enjoyed a included breakfast in the morning.
Continental breakfast and in room hot tub.

Staff was wonderful from check in to check out. You can actually smell the cleanliness of this hotel. Would recommend if staying in Mt. Pleasant.
Comfortable bed, updated rooms and carpeting throughout. Pool is good to let's children play.
