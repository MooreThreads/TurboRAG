Photor’s 1928 “How Long How Long Blues,” found its most success ful proponent in Brown, who in turn deeply influenced several generations of R&B performers, from Floyd Dixon and Ray Charles to Sam Cooke; Cooke’s 1960 “Bring It On Home to Me” is a direct extension of Brown’s 1959 “I Want To Go Home.” His impact was far-reaching: Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun cites Brown’s ’s One More for the Road up to his most recent Verve titles, he cut a series of stunningly perfect albums that completely outstripped his classic late-’40s–early-’50s recordings. Laden with atmosphere, emotionally charged yet never florid, each was a masterpiece of low-key expression.
That’s no small feat, as Brown’s string of postwar hits — among them “Drifting Blues” (which he had written as a teenager, and which went on to sell hundreds of thousands of copies, becoming Cashbox’s top R&B record of 1946); “Trouble Blues,” No. 1 in ’49; “Black Night,” No. 1 in ’51 — were some of the day’s most finely wrought rhythm & blues. 1949’s “Merry Christmas, Baby” became a perennial after it went to No. 9 on the R&B charts and was subsequently reissued the following year and again in 1954 — come December, you’ll still find it on jukeboxes in black neighborhoods across the country.
Brown first made his mark in wartime Los Angeles as pianist with Johnny Moore’s ‘Drifting Blues’ came out, the birthrate shot up 90 percent!”
As a blues singer, Brown conveyed a sense of abject desolation; he was an inconsolable everyman who cut to the very heart of that most common life experience: misery. Brown’s’s’s ist’s he’ll be posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame next month further underscores the enormity of this loss.
