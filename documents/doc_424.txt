One Night and Seven Churches TONIGHT
For the sixth year in a row on Holy Thursday, Broadway Fillmore Alive has put together a self-guided tour of seven historic churches in the Broadway-Fillmore area partaking in the traditional visitation of the Blessed Sacrament on this holy night. Holy Thursday is on April 05, 2012.
Churches on this year’s tour include: Corpus Christi, Saint Ann, Saint Stanislaus, Saint Luke’s Mission of Mercy, Saint Adalbert Basilica, Saint John Kanty and Saint Clare.
The visitation period generally begins after 7:00 pm and the churches remain open till around 11:00 pm.
In our first year, we had about 50 requests for the tour info. The number of requests over the last few years has risen to over 500.
