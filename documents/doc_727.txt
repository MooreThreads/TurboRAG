Toby Jones Has Leave To Remain
He's set for the coming-of-age drama
While he deals with the déjà vu of someone getting more attention for playing the same role at the same time (competing Alfred Hitchcock projects instead of Truman Capote this time), we doubt Toby Jones is all that worried. He has plenty to keep him busy, including joining the cast of Bruce Goodison’s Leave To Remain.
Goodison is switching from documentaries to fiction for this one, which will mix professional actors like Jones with young migrants and refugees for a coming-of-age tale.
The plot will follow a group of teenagers from various countries who are looking to build a new life in London. Goodison researched the film for three years before putting the cast together, and he’s now shooting in the capital.
Before we get to see the finished product, however, Jones will be returning to a very different capital – the Capitol – for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which will hit our screens on November 22 next year. He’s also playing Sheriff McDowell alongside Games lead Jennifer Lawrence in Susanne Bier’s new drama Serena.
