Information - Interior equipment
The interior of the car offers car owners a lot of ways to personalize their car. On the other hand, a lot of car owners prefer to keep the original interior of the car salon. It is especially important for owners of antique vehicles and luxury cars, since their cost will reduce because of these transformations. For ordinary cars it is not a big problem.
LED interior lighting is very common when speaking about tuning. Various creative solutions are possible even for coverings. Standard gear lever knob and cups are usually replaced with sports version. The same is about the steering wheel. Often it is replaced with a small and handy one. Sport pedals, which are available in different variants, are also very popular. In any case, you should always use licensed spare parts. The reason is that in the event of an accident there can be problems with insurance. Be careful when using used parts.
Salon equipment also includes belts, door handles, chrome inserts and many other parts. For each of the original parts there is produced a corresponding spare part. Often it is possible to built-in a part that looks differently. Thus, the interior of the car can be changed both slightly or completely. Each car owner decides how far he can go when modifying the car salon. The majority of production cars look great with the original factory interior.
