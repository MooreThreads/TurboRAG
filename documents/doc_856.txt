An energy-based discontinuous Galerkin method for dynamic Euler-Bernoulli beam equations
@article{Zhang2021AnED, title={An energy-based discontinuous Galerkin method for dynamic Euler-Bernoulli beam equations}, author={Lu Zhang}, journal={ArXiv}, year={2021}, volume={abs/2109.07033} }
In this paper, an energy-based discontinuous Galerkin method for dynamic Euler-Bernoulli beam equations is developed. The resulting method is energy-dissipating or energy-conserving depending on the simple, mesh-independent choice of numerical fluxes. By introducing a velocity field, the original problem is transformed into a first-order in time system. In our formulation, the discontinuous Galerkin approximations for the original displacement field and the auxiliary velocity field are not… Expand

This paper develops the paradigm of the local discontinuous Galerkin method by introducing the second-order spatial derivative as an auxiliary variable instead of the conventional first-order derivative, and derives optimal L-error estimates of the scheme that measure both the solution and the auxiliary variable.
