For any company doing business on a global basis, strategic alliances and partnerships are a crucial factor in order to succeed in different markets. For MFNâ€™s publication and training organization, China is potentially one of the most important markets. After all, it is the largest metal finishing production area in the world. After evaluating various partners in China over the past years, MFN is very satisfied to finally sign an agreement to become the official cooperation partner of SF EXPO China.
The SF EXPO China is one of China's largest exhibitions of its kind. It is host to the latest and most updated surface treatment, painting, raw material galvanization, processing equipment and corrosion prevention technology. The organizers not only make full use of the professional resources at their disposal, the member enterprises, the foreign partnerships, the professional organizations and specialized buyer databases, but also combine the show with the annual meeting of the China Surface Finishing Engineering Association, Electroplating Branch, and with a series of forums, seminars and technology promotion conferences. The SF EXPO China has typically an exposure area of 15'000 square meters, around 350 exhibitors and 18'000 visitors.
The cooperation between MFN and SF EXPO China maximizes local and international networking, takes advantage of marketing synergies and increases the visibility of both organizations. While SF EXPO China may reach more international exhibitors and visitors via MFN's access to nearly 70 countries, MFN will be able to present itself better in the Chinese market by using classroom and booth space at the exhibition. Doing so, MFN can offer its training means to a very large crowd. After keeping many years good partnership with SF EXPO, it is planned to continue a long term relationship in which both partners can increase their market shares.
