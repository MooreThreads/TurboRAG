Despite the clear health benefits of regular physical activity and an increased concern in healthy lifestyle in this era, The National Statistical Office of Thailand found that less than 30% of Thais regularly engaged in physical activity in 2007. On average one-fourth of Thais are overweight and the most alarming fact at present is an incredibly high prevalence of obesity among the children aged between 2-18 years old. Common excuses for inactivity for instance, lack of time, sport facilities and equipment demonstrate contradictory findings as in Thailand almost all of 76 provinces have standard sport grounds and public parks at the community level. Unfortunately, an available database indicates that only one-third of 50,768 stadiums/grounds and 12,880 small public parks are currently utilized.
Therefore, Thai Health Promotion Foundation (ThaiHealth) initiated a master plan to promote physical activities and sports for Health to better enable individuals and communities to engage in physical activity and sports as part of living a healthier lifestyle.

This plan aims at encouraging people of all ages and genders in every part of the country to engage in physical activities and sports as an integral part of their lives.
