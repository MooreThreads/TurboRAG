Pros
Cons
The Casio Exilim EX-ZR100 is a mid-cost digital camera, a flagship offering. Casio promotes the EX-ZR100 as offering more features than you might expect from such a small design. The Exilim Engine HS (with dual core processors) allows for high-speed shooting (.37 second shot-to-shot time, thanks to its continuous shutter feature), as well as high-speed image processing. This engine is also capable of facilitating slow-motion video recording. The Exilim EX-ZR100's 24-300mm lens is wide-angle (and can be extended up to 600mm with Casio's High-speed SR zoom technology). This camera features a 12.1 megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor with shift stabilization, which helps to ensure high-resolution images with low noise, even in dimly lit environments. This sensor also helps to reduce the blur associated with hand movement. The Exilim EX-ZR100 can capture 1920x1080 full HD video at 30 frames-per-second (fps) with continuous auto focus. This camera gives you the option of leveraging its full optical zoom and capture digital still images with high-speed burst shooting at 10MP while recording video. With burst shooting, you can capture thirty 10MP images at a maximum speed of forty shots per second. This model differs from the lower cost Exilim ZR-10 model in that the Exilim ZR-10 has a 7x optical zoom that can be extended up to 14x (whereas the Exilim EX-ZR100 has a 12.5x optical zoom that can be extended up to 25x), has a 28mm wide-angle lens, and lacks the EX-ZR100's Prerecord CS feature (which starts shooting video before you have fully pressed the shutter button, saving them to a continuously refreshed buffer). The Casio Exilim EX-ZR100 has a three inch LCD display on which all photos and video can be reviewed.
