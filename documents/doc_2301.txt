So, today was pretty boring.. I woke up around 12 put my clothes in the wash, then put my clothes in the dryer, waited till around 2 then hopped in the shower, got my hair did, changed into my work clothes "just my black banks and black undershirt" went upstairs where I found my brothers were going to subways, invited myself, got me a yummy footlong. "oh yeah ;D" Ate half of it" OH YEAH ;D" put it away for later "Kinky" Put my work shirt and apron on, updue my hair, and off to work I went! Of course I was on backline making the sammiches... This kid I work with just went on and on about how amazing Watchmen was "Blah.." Then we just started naming funny/awesome movies. Closing time came "FINALLY!" He was emptying the shake machine, he went back to do the dishes, and TOTALLY forgot about the shakemix, you hear my manager screaming "JAY!! DAMNIT TO HELL!!" He runs up there, I come walking up just to find a huge overflow! we were like drowing in shakemix... So that threw us off!! We did not get out till 12:30, and usually we get out around 11:50. It sucked so bad!!! Then it started to rain like hell, so I had to wait for my mom to come get me, and she is a very slow driver! I LIVE 5 MINS AWAY DRIVING DISTANCE, 15 MINS IF I WALK!! It took her 30 mins to come get me!!
I ache all over, I just want to crawl into bed and die! I have to do it all over again tomorrow too! I hate closing!!!!! ... It's good money tho. ^,.,^ YAY MONEY!!!
Money, money, money.... MONEY!!!
