Abstract
O-group wild turbot (Scophthalmus maximus (L.)) were used in a number of feeding experiments designed to assess the usefulness of readily available species of industrial fish as feed for the ongrowing stage of cultivation (10-500 g). Sprats (Sprattus sprattus (L.)) and sandeels (Ammodytes marinus Raitt) were the most successful in that feeding rates of 2% live weight per feed gave conversion efficiencies which were generally better than 3:1. A regular regime of two feeds a day should give growth rates approaching 2% per day resulting in an ongrowing period of about 200 days at 16°C. The turbot were maintained in closed recirculating systems using a simple design for the treatment units. These provided a stable environment in which to conduct the experiments the average water quality conditions being given. There were few health problems and the taste and texture of the fish produced appeared to be good. © 1982.
