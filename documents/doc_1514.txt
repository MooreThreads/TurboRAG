The Victory Outreach Recovery Homes Ministry provides a residential, Christian environment for men and women. The purpose of the Homes is to reclaim, redeem, and restore lives that have been destroyed or disrupted by drugs, alcohol and/or other substance abuse by establishing three essential values; a commitment to Christ, restoration of the family and a positive work ethic. A drug user is often a product of his environment. That\'s why our Recovery Homes first get them off the mean streets and into a caring Home. Once there, the addict or alcoholic begins an intensive faith-based, one-year program that restores the whole person. The leaders who run the Homes know it\'s not an easy road, because many of them are ex-addicts themselves. Yet through their tough-love, compassion and support, they\'ve seen tremendous results. There is no charge for this one-year program, but each person earns their recovery and stay. May God Bless you in the days ahead.
