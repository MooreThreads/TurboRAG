Hi Paula! Your card is so yummy! Imagine how happy the bright colors and cupcake will make the recipient? I love that pinking edge SB; must look for that. And thanks for your comment at my blog today; coming from you it means so much to me!
Paula, Thank you for the great write-up! I am so sharing your creation in my May 7, 2013 Coloring Page Tuesday newsletter - the big 5th anniversary celebration one! Thanks for your support over the years and I hope my images are still a help for all the OWH creators! (If they're not subscribed, they can do so at - and see the entire collection there too!)
Cheers and happy coloring!
