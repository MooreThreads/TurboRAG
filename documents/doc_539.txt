Blush Colored Gems at Long Beach Farmers Markets
Walk through any Long Beach Farmers’ Market and baskets are overflowing with beautiful ripe blush colored fruit. Cling free peaches are the ones everybody loves to eat. White peaches are the sweetest. The fun donut shaped peach has velvet skin, and is not quite as sweet as the others. When picking out the perfect peach make sure there is a blush color near the stem and on the shoulder of the peach under the deep yellow and orange tones. This shows that the peach ripened on the tree, and will have the most flavor. Peaches do not store well, and tend to bruise easily. So be sure to handle them will care.
Plant a Tree
Peaches originated in China and date back to the 10th Century. They were the Emperor’s favorite fruit, and quickly travelled the Silk Road to Persia. Spanish explorers brought them to South America. George Minifle brought peaches to the New World in the 17th Century, and planted a peach tree on an estate in Virginia. It later became Georgia’s state fruit.
California is the number one producer of peaches in the United State. China is the largest producer in the world with Italy at a close second. Living in Southern California it makes sense to plant a peach tree in your garden. Plant it in early winter, and in a spot that gets full sun. It requires regular watering, and be sure to increase the water right before harvest. Peach trees are a good pollen source for honey bees
