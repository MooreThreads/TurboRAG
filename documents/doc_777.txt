I have lived here for almost three years. I got an excellent buy on the model home I wanted but because many of these homes are forty
Years old and owned by a much older crowd they are in need of a complete gut job. I fixed my home up to my liking, all new kitchen,
Bathrooms, flooring, central air etc. I love my home but this community is not 55 and up, it's more like 75 and up. I have met some nice people but most people are 20 years older than me.
I didn't realize that when I purchased. We are lacking an indoor which I would've liked. If you are looking for a younger crowd this is not the place for you. When homes are sold they are sold to extreme seniors. The newer developments with younger people are very pricey so people have to realize that when they are shopping for a new home. Also the hoa fees are expensive.
