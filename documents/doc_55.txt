Easter is right around the corner, which means Peeps season is in full swing!
Have you ever made a Peeps creation so special that it brought a tear to your eye? Do you have a Peeps masterpiece waiting inside you? If so, we want to see it!
We’ll feature the very best of your Peeps right here on Babble. Here’s what you need to do:
It’s pretty simple: Email your Peeps photo to strollerderby@gmail.com. Or you can upload your photo to Babble’s Facebook wall.
It can be creatively decorated Peeps, or an entire Peeps scene. We’ll feature as many as we can in an upcoming piece before Easter. The more creative, the better.
Let the Peeps-ing begin!
PS Here are just a few ways you can have fun with Peeps!
