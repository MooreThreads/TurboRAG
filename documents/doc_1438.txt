The Emmy-nominated (and past two-time winner) "Breaking Bad" star has announced a scavenger hunt for anyone in the Hollywood area as a lead-in to Monday night's Emmys awards. Paul announced the challenge on his Instagram account (see below).

Basically, he's given anyone living outside the Hollywood area four days to get to LA in order to participate, a heads up many New Mexico fans undoubtedly appreciate. Details beyond what's posted in the feed are scarce, but it's not the first time Paul has provided a competition to build excitement for his star-making show.
To build anticipation perhaps past the breaking point for the final eight episodes of "Breaking Bad," Paul held a scavenger hunt in Boise, Idaho last September. Winners got to watch a live stream of "Ozymandias," the soul-crushing episode directed by Rian Johnson. The fun-loving Paul also hid tickets to a series finale screening with he and Bryan Cranston around Hollywood the day the show ended its incredible run.
Don't count on the prizes for his latest scavenger hunt to be in the same place, though. The 66th Annual Primetime Emmys air Monday night at 8pm ET / 5pm PT at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles (and live on NBC). "Breaking Bad" is nominated for eight Emmys, including Paul for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama.
