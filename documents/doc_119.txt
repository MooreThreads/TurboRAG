MARS in Capricorn is in his exaltation. his {348} quality expressed in the world of action is Theodore Roosevelt. One has only to contemplate his method to understand the full effect of Mars in Capricorn.
In the world of science, we have two men of incomparable vigor and persistence, Pasteur and Edison; while, to return once again to political life, we find Edward VII with this position of Mars. This is a very astonishing case; there is little of high ability to be found in this monarch, but Mars, rising in this sign, gave him the executive force to carry through the Triple Entente, one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in the world's history.
Goethe also has this position; in this connection we notice the brusquerie of much of his verse, its leaping, forceful, direct quality. That any man could win such signal triumph is amazing; the art of poetry seems to demand smoothness rather than this abrupt sledge-hammer method. Rossetti, for example, with the same position, scores only partial success. The rough scansion of much of his verse must be called a flaw, whereas with Goethe it was a virtue. But Rossetti's Mars is in conjunction with Neptune and in opposition to Saturn, with no buttress to such aspects but a distant trine of the Sun, while Goethe's Mars is trine to Mercury and the Sun.
Ruskin and Tolstoi have also this position, but Ruskin's Mars is the storm-centre of a great complex, which considerably modifies the effect, while Tolstoi's is in conjunction with Neptune, increasing its eccentricity and violence by harnessing materialism with mysticism. A better illustration of the effect of this position is Savonarola. Here we see clearly the sudden fierce resolution and the tenacity of purpose. Afflictions by Saturn and the Moon tended to increase the asperity of the method, and doubtless they contributed to its failure; but the method is indicated clearly enough by the position.
Among women we have Cleo de Merode with the Moon trine and the Sun and Venus in square to Mars. From this comes her incomparable power to have her own way in everything. Incidentally, the planet is on the cusp of her eleventh house, and its main effect is therefore to enable her to influence friends. The trine of the Moon includes the public among such friends, and modifies the fierceness of her method by masking it with a show of yielding grace. In reality, she was just as full of will and determination as Cromwell.
