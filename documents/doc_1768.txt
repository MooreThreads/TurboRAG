Three years ago, we began an annual tradition. Creating a high quality, vintage style, LARGE poster full of dynamic, retro automotive goodness – complete with a 12 month calendar.
This year, I'm celebrating the 1955 Mille Miglia. Sir Stirling Moss's greatest racing achievement and one of the most important moments in Mercedes-Benz history. It was a record-smashing victory for a young British driver in a new German car – and on some incredibly treacherous Italian roads.
This poster/calendar features that iconic race, and will be LOADED with details. The map in the upper right contains information from over a year of research while creating my award-winning book The Greatest Race. Notes including Mercedes-Benz fuel stops, locations of wrecks of other notable drivers, notes of driver and navigator errors – all checked (and edited) by Sir Stirling Moss himself as we poured over my research at Lime Rock Park in 2015.
Posters delivering around the first of the year 2019.
