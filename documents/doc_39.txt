We believe that the nonprofit sector is a powerful catalyst for positive societal change, but will not realize its full potential until it maximizes the power of inclusion and diversity, starting in the boardroom. The DiverseForce On Boards program was founded in 2017 to address the lack of racial/ethnic diversity on nonprofit boards. Our program is designed to train professionals of color on board governance and to facilitate their placement on governing boards. The program curriculum focuses on three key areas:
Board Preparation - Participants gain in-depth training and preparation to serve on the governing board for nonprofit organizations. The curriculum covers board leadership and governance topics which include strategic planning, financial leadership, legal roles and responsibilities, fundraising, and more.
Leadership - Board participation is an excellent way to exercise leadership competence. Through our culturally-informed leadership "lunch & learns" with a certified executive leadership coach, participants develop a deeper understanding of their personal leadership style and how to prepare for more complex roles in any organization.
Inclusion & Diversity - Participants are empowered to be change agents on boards by helping organizations to be more culturally-align with the communities they serve. Inclusive and diverse teams make better decisions and can help to expand the networks of funders, volunteers, and other key stakeholders. Participants will learn steps to institutionalizing inclusivity and diversity.
