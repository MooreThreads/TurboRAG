Shine Your Light/
Now, more than ever, I believe it's time to let our light shine. Big. Bright. Beautiful. Loving. Kind. Compassionate. Like the song, Let it shine, let it shine let it shine!
Many of us are surprised, some are horrified, others are very happy about the turn of events in the United States. I have felt all of those feelings. And what I am left with is the fact that I need, no, I want to love more. I want to find the light in everything and everyone I look at, even the not-so-nice parts. Whether those parts are in me or in others, my commitment is to do my best to bring them into the light. That's the way things can shift.
This time has been called the Time of Awakening by many who came before. It's the time we've been waiting for. And all of us are here on purpose. And we have a purpose. To usher in a new way of being that is more loving and more spiritual. It is the time when the human spirit awakens to the power of light and the power of healing to transform life. Are you up to the challenge?
No matter how you voted, it's pretty obvious that things need to change. Trump is a man who has highlighted the shadow of America. And since I believe that things are always working out for me and for everyone else, I have to believe that this is a good thing. That there is a reason and that it will serve us. I simply will not go back to some old way of thinking that goes something like, "Why is this happening to me or to us?"
So what have I been doing about this? I've been talking to everyone I know, clients, friends, Uber drivers, anyone who will listen. And I tell them how I'm feeling. That I'm reaching into my soul to love more. And, so far, I find that people are listening. And that they are feeling a bit better, a bit lighter, a bit more positive. And if my light can help even one person, then I've done a good job for the day.
