In "The Key to the Universe" Severian mentions that the Hieros are the master species, the ones created by man and who escaped to Yesod. The Hierodules were "found" by the Hieros and are their servants. Famulimus and Barbatus appear to be Hieros, while I would assume that many of the watchers of "Eschatology and Genesis" at the House Absolute were Hierodules. <<Despite this great power, they are material, and I believe fallible and wrongheaded, creatures, no different from any other "superior" alien species in science fiction with political or strategic interests in the Terran sphere.>> I think that the "judge" version of Tzadkiel, analogous to the Archangel Michael, would be certainly be divine. Whether of not he receives communication directly from the Pancreator is one of the more interesting mysteries of _Urth_. <<They have interfered with Urth's sun for their own purposes (which possibly include hobbling the ability of Urrth's tyrants -- or more importantly, her extra-solar "guests" -- to wage wars of interstellar conquest>> Refer to "The Key to the Universe" again. Severian explains that the Hieros are shaping us as they were formed, a payback (but not necessarily negative), and the appearance of the New Sun would mean that "at least the earliest operations of this shaping are complete." It means Severian is a puppet, but there is no such thing as free will when dealing with the Divine, I would guess. <<"'The Pancreator is infinitely far from us,' the angel said. 'And thus infinitely far from me, though I fly so much higher than you. I guess at his desires -- no one can do otherwise.'">> This is preceded in "Eschatology and Genesis" in the dialogue between Gabiel and Nod. Also, there is the story of how the Pancreator was behind a curtain, but when one peaked behind this curtain, he saw open space, because the Pancreator is infinite (and perhaps thus infinitely remote). I wonder in what other Wolfe works this idea that God is infinitely remote is mentioned. Christopher R. Culver <crculver@aol.com> *More Wolfe info & archive of this list at
