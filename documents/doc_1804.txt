Our Lady of the rosary Church – 22 Notre Dame Ave., Dayton, Ohio
What makes this event great is the friendly volunteers. The staff are kind, dedicated and have been doing this for years. The party is all inclusive and you are not “nickel and dimed” for extra beers, etc.. For these reasons, this is the best fish fry in the Miami Valley area, in our humble opinion. There are old folks, young folks and ages in between.
So now you know about this little known secret. Will we see you on Friday? No better place for a Food Adventure !
