Brilliant bowling complemented a stabilising innings from Stafanie Taylor as West Indies Women defeated South Africa Women by 52 runs, yesterday, in an encouraging start to their preparations for the ICC Women’s World Twenty20 2014.
Taylor slammed an unbeaten 45 to help her team post 123 for four in 20 overs after overcoming the early setback of losing opener Kycia Knight.
An all-round bowling effort from the Caribbean women snuffed out any resistance from the South Africans who crumbled for 71 runs in 18.5 overs.
West Indies Women, who won the toss and chose to bat, were 71 for three after losing Deandra Dottin cheaply in the 11th over.
Taylor, who struck three fours and a six, shared a 54-run stand with Chinelle Henry for the fourth wicket.
Henry scored 25 while Natasha McLean, who opened with Knight, chipped in with a 24-ball 26 before being caught behind off Dane van Niekerk.
In her four overs, Shabnim Ismail returned two for 12 to be the pick of the South African bowlers.
The West Indies bowlers proved too much for their opponents who did not put up a fight except for Trisha Chetty, who scored 16, and Yolandi van der Westhuizen, who top-scored with 24.
No other South Africa batters reached double figures.
Anisa Mohammed, the right-arm spinner, and Dottin returned figures of two for six and two for seven, respectively.
Tremayne Smartt, Subrina Munroe, Shaquana Quintyne, Shakera Selman and Shemaine Campbelle picked up a wicket each.
West Indies play their second and final warm-up match against Australia, on Friday, while South Africa take on Bangladesh on the same day.
