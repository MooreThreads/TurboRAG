Of course, you could join a carbon offset program such as TerraPass. By contributing to TerraPass or any one of a number of programs like it, your dollars fund renewable energy projects. The theory is that you are offsetting the carbon output that you’re creating through your flights, car rentals, etc.
A worthy idea, indeed. But what about your personal responsibility to the environment? There are a couple of simple things you can do to help.
* Ask the hotel cleaning staff not to change your towels and linens during your stay. This can potentially save a tremendous amount of water. Many hotels suggest this as an option but even if yours doesn’t, make the request anyway (or keep the do not disturb sign on your door so that the cleaning staff doesn’t enter at all).
* Keep the heat and air conditioning down and turn off all the lights and the television when you leave the room. Small amounts of electricity add up to make a big difference.
* Take short showers and don’t allow the water to run continuously when you’re brushing your teeth and shaving.
* If you’re driving, take your most environmentally friendly vehicle. Sure, the SUV is convenient for hauling the cooler and all your bags, but think of the gas you’ll save if you hopped into the Ford Focus instead!
You may already do many of these things in your own home. However, you ignore them when you’re on the road because you’re not paying for the water or electricity at a hotel. We’ll all be better off if we can start following some rules of conservation while we’re traveling. Plus, you’ll make Al happier
Happy Travels!
