Your pledge rewards will be shipped in July!
Each set comes with everything you need to play and you can use up to four sets to customize your deck.

As a special Kickstarter campaign bonus, for each copy of the game, you'll receive a copy of an original, limited-edition Paint The Line comic book by the folks at Penny Arcade!

Paint the Line is a Cold War era ping pong card game. Players hit the ball back and forth by rolling a 20 sided die in an attempt to meet or exceed a target number. Players play cards to aid their dice rolls and penalize their opponent’s rolls.
Check out this article at MTV Geek previewing the game and discussing the development.

This Springboard campaign is being run by Game Salute, who is working with Penny Arcade to bring Paint The Line to individuals and Select Stores all around the world. The purpose of a Kickstarter campaign is to make a public show of support for Paint The Line to help expand its presence. As part of our celebration of the launch of Paint The Line, this campaign will help show the world how much support this independently developed title can gain here.
Certainly, you can preorder directly through PA or through this Kickstarter campaign, as you prefer. Either way you're directly supporting Penny Arcade and Paint The Line. This campaign serves as a public meter of sorts for the excitement around this title (really the entire Paint The Line game line). Your support will help Springboard this title into the hands of individual fans as well as stores and local game groups all around the world. Thanks for your support!
You'll be able to get Paint The Line through Penny Arcade's online store, through Shop.GameSalute.com, and through any local store who's signed up as a Select Store (and if they're not yet, it just takes a minute at). You can find those stores at. The game will begin appearing in stores who participate in Preview Nights very soon, and they'll have demo copies of the game to show off in person! The official retail release of the game isn't until August, so only stores who participate in Preview Nights will have it early.
