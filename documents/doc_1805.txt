Location was good, being about 5 minutes walk to the town centre. Staff and owners made your stay a pleasure. Very accommodating to your needs and they supply a good quality lunch box which is a must for this area.

Location, helpfulness of owner, great for a family of four, nice breakfast included. One can have the owner prepare a Korean bag lunch for trekking.

Staff was really helpful. Especially Susanna was alway ready to find an answer for any kind of request from booking a restaurant, providing information to get us in a trekking tour.

Nice place one block from main street. Very well heated. The down cabin is some noisy with people upstairs. Good value for the money.
