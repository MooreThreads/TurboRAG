CARNIVAL @ Sankeys Ibiza
Saturday 30th June – Saturday 15th September
Let the party begin.
Saturday – usually the biggest night out in any country – has for some reason not been a high-light on the Ibiza calendar. In 2012 all this will change.
Carnival – Sankeys Ibiza’s own night – is pulling out all the stops for Saturday nights in Ibiza, with unparalleled line-ups that you wont find anywhere else on the island and a promise of raucous fun… as you would expect the name depicts…
Guests throughout the summer include Heidi – presenting The Jackathon, dOP Live, Chez Damier, Matt Tolfrey, Shonky, Dinky, Anja Scheider, Detroit’s newest import Kyle Hall, Miguel Campbell, Seuil, Glimpse LIVE, Kink LIVE, DJ T, Subb-An LIVE, 2000 and One plus weekly resident/promoter, Bones, and many more.
“To say I am looking forward to this season is well and truly an understatement!! The club has a truly epic roll call of talent lined up and the opportunity to host and play alongside artists I deeply respect is really exciting to me, and to be able to bring them to a intimate audience in such a unique setting as Sankeys is a great privilege and we are very much ready to have a Carnival in Playa d’en Bossa!” – Bones (Carnival resident and promoter)
