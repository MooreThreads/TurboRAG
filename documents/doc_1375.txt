Edificio I+D
Most BIFI's premises are located at Edificio I+D ("R&D building"), situated in the Campus RÃ­o Ebro ("Ebro river campus") of the University of Zaragoza, in the north of the city.
Inside the building, which we share with other UNIZAR's research institutes, we count with 20 laboratories (782 m2), 22 offices (477 m2) and some common premises (library and coffee room, 76 m2), distributed around the 3 floors of the building. In particular, our facilities are in areas 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 1.2.
We also benefit from the use of the shared premises and services of the building.
We moved to Edificio I+D during the first months of 2010, although the building was not officially inaugurated until 19th April of that year.
