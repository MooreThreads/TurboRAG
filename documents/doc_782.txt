Saturday in West Texas was beautiful. It was the kind of day that should be spent entirely outdoors, from breakfast to dinner. So what did I do in this weather? Laid in bed hungover lamenting the fact that my husband was golfing while my head was throbbing. After my petite pity party, I texted a fellow abandoned wife, and it was decided that we would drink white wine on the patio and eat chips and salsa. So off I went to the store, to buy all the stuff for salsa, and a six pack of Sav. B. I’m pretty sure the salsas were good, but honestly, I cannot guarantee. What I do know is that don’t challenge two ladies to drink as much white wine as they can before the sun goes down…it’s a challenge we will win lose.
Roasted Poblano Salsa
- 3 roasted poblano peppers
- 3 jalapeños, 2 without seeds
- 2 Serrano peppers
- 1 bunch cilantro
- 1 large avocado
- ½ large white onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1 tsp. salt
- Juice of 1 lime
- 3 tomatillos, boiled in water for 8 minutes until soft
- ½ c to 1 c. water
Literally just toss everything into a blender with ½ c water to start. Add more water to thin out as necessary. This stays good for 2-3 days and makes a ton.
Weird Orange Salsa
- 6 tomatoes, quartered
- 10 chili de arbol, rehydrated (soak in hot water for an hour) these chilis are usually found in the Mexican aisle where all the “Fiesta” brand spices are
- 1 white onion, quartered
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 2 tbs. powdered chicken broth (warning, this has MSG, so if you are anti MSG, which technically we all should be, find a brand that doesn’t have it.)
Sautee all the ingredients except for the chicken broth until tender. About 10 minutes. Add to a blender and add the chicken broth and blend until smooth. This is awkwardly orange. Also—I would never have known that the secret ingredient was powdered chicken broth unless Megan told me.
Regular-ish Salsa
- 1 can rotel
- 2 small tomatoes
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 small onion
- 1 bunch cilantro
- Juice of 1 lime
Blend everything together. Surely by now you get the jist. Salsa is easy. Just blend shit together and try it with chips.
Apparently these all go well with 100$ worth of Mr. Gattis. I recommend a slice of hamburger pizza dipped in ranch, then dipped in green salsa. #newlow
