Traveling on a Budget
Some people think that to travel and see the world; you have to stay in a 5-star hotel every night, eat at the fanciest restaurants, see every attraction that the city offers, and buy a suitcase full of souvenirs to take home. Real travelers know that this is not the case. Sure, traveling can be expensive, but there are quite a few painless ways to make a wonderful, memorable vacation within your reach.
When to go
Travel seasons have a vast range in prices, depending on when you go. If you want to go during peak season, you are going to pay for it. Just remember that “off-season” doesn’t mean that it is a wrong time to go; it usually just means that you will get more value for your money with fewer people thrown in. It may still be a fantastic trip, possibly even better than ordinary, considering you don’t need to worry so much about cash or audiences.
How to get there
It used to be that driving was always the cheapest way to get places, but with rising fuel costs, that isn’t still the case anymore. Be sure to do your research to calculate gas costs before assuming driving would be the most economical. Should you wind up flying, make sure you look around, such as budget airlines, to receive the ideal cost. Consider flying on non-peak days or at non-peak times to get the best price. (Yes, this includes taking the dreaded red-eye!)
Where to stay
When you get to your destination, staying at the Four Seasons isn’t the only option. Think about places where you can stay with friends or family for a few days; that way, you can visit and get a free place to stay. (Always remember to be a good house guest though to ensure you remain friends!) Another option is doing a home exchange where a family would stay in your house while you are in their place. It’s an excellent way to observe the region you’re visiting through a neighborhood’s eye, not pay for resorts in any way.
How to get around
Grabbing a cab each time that you wish to go anyplace can consume your money pretty quickly. If you’re in a city using public transit, look at carrying that as your principal point of transport. Conquering the public transit system in another place gives you a feeling of triumph like no other. If you’ve to lease a car for a holiday, shop around to find the best price and see whether there are some coupons on the market or revenue running in the time before you reserve it.
What to do
Once you are at your destination, don’t think that you have to see every attraction there. Pick and choose based on your family’s wants and needs and remember there are heaps of free or cheap Items in many cities such as museums, churches, and national parks, which may be a wonderful idea to spend the afternoon.
