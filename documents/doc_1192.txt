Ugh! This has been a bad week for me when it comes to exercise. I am doing a check in for the last weeks; last week was great, this week not so much. Last week, I got in 5 workouts- 3 runs (about 30 minutes each) and 2 sessions of 'Ripped in 30'. This week my daughter started having sleep issues and we're trying to get ready for company so I only got in 3 30 minute runs. I did finish week 5 of Couch 2 5K and the last run was HARD but I am proud of myself for doing it. I had to run for 20 minutes straight; this used to be nothing for me but since I'm pretty much out of shape, it was super rough.
I'm hoping to get back on track next week with at least 5 workouts (preferably 6) per week and get back to using My Fitness Pal to track what I'm eating. My clothes are getting tight so I really need to get on top of monitoring my food intake.
I'm definitely going to commit to regular exercise for the month of July. I think overall, I did a good job of making exercise a priority in June (with the exception of this week) and I'm hoping to keep up with it for July (and maybe actually lose some weight!).
