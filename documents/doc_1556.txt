Parents Group P.O.'d About New Twitcom
A parents group is threatening to cause a $#*!-storm for CBS affiliates if they don’t do something about a new sitcom in the works. The Parents Television Council, which monitors obscenities on network TV, said they’ll challenge the broadcast license of any network channel that airs the new sitcom before 10 p.m. or even advertises it.
The TV show in question is likely about a curmudgeonly 73-year-old father who dispenses nuggets of wisdom to his adult son still living at home. But that’s not the obscene part (though really, get your own place, man).
The show is based on 28-year-old Justin Halpern’s popular Twitter feed, “Sh*t My Dad Says,” and has 1.5 million followers. (Do we get to call it at Twit-com?)
Though the network has changed the name of the show to “$#*! My Dad Says,” and will be referred to as “(Bleep) My Dad Says,” the Parents Television Council argues that merely alluding to an obscenity is in itself obscene and unfit for children.
The show is slated to air 8:30 p.m. on Thursdays. Of course there will be heavy promoting until then. The council is watching and listening and ready to pounce.
Would you mind your child watching an ad for the show? Do you think it’s obscene?
