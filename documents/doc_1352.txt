How green is your home? Is your property efficient? Your homeâ€™s efficiency is important, especially in these eco-conscious times. Maintaining a high level of efficiency is an effective way to reduce your monthly outgoings too. Energy efficient windows and doors can help you save precious and valuable energy. When was the last time you checked your current windows for draughts?
Save Energy. Save On Bills.
When it comes to conserving energy it's simple. Save on energy and save on money. Maintaining a good level of home efficiency will really help you to save on those pennies and pounds. A well-insulated home will not only contribute towards a greener environment but has the added benefit of protecting your wallet too.
Our energy efficient Duraflex windows will help save you money on your heating bills by retaining warmth and reducing the amount of energy needed to heat your home. A glass metallic coating successfully works to reflect heat back inside your property. How clever is that?
