>We believe in the plenary verbal
inspiration of the Bible and that God’s
Word is the final authority for faith,
life and conduct. (II Timothy 3:16; John 17:17)
>We believe that God preserved His
Word without error to the present day. We
believe that the Masoretic Text and the
Textus Receptus have been
providentially preserved and that the
King James Bible (or Authorized Version) is an
accurate translation of these texts.
Therefore, we believe that the King James
Bible is inerrant. (Psalms 12:6,7)
>We believe that Bible translations
into other languages must be based on the
Masoretic Text and the Textus Receptus
to be accurate.

creator of all things, infinitely holy, and
eternally existent in three persons,
The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit.
(I John 5:7)

Christ. (John 1:1,14,18; Colossians 1:15; 2:9)
>We believe in the virgin birth of
Jesus Christ. (Isaiah 7:14; Micah 5:2; Luke 1:30-38)
>We believe in the Deity and
personality of the Holy Spirit. It is He that
convicts the world of sin, regenerates
those who believe. He also indwells,
empowers, guides, teaches and
sanctifies the believer. (Acts 5:3,4; John 16:7,8)
>We believe that man was created in
the image of God and by choice fell into
sin and death. Because of Adam’s
sin, all mankind is sinful and under
condemnation to eternal judgment.
(Genesis 1:26,27; Isaiah 53:6; Romans 3:23)
>We believe in the substitutionary
death of Christ on Calvary. (Matthew 27:45-61; II Corinthians 5:21) It is the

possible. (I Peter 1:18,19)
>We believe in the bodily
resurrection of Jesus Christ. (Matthew 28:1-20; Luke 24:1-48)

grace through faith in the finished work of
Christ. (Ephesians 2:8,9) Biblical
repentance is absolutely necessary for
salvation. (Acts 20:21) The change
mentioned in II Corinthians 5:17 is a direct result of
repentance and faith.

of the believer. (John 3:15-18; John 10:26-30; Romans 8:28-39)
>We believe that all redeemed ones
are called into a life of separation from
all worldly and sinful practices. (I John 2:15-17)

Satan as taught in the Word of God. (Isaiah 14:12-15; Ezekiel 28:12-19; Revelations 12:7-10; Job 1:6-2:8)

place prepared for the Devil and his
angels. Those who do not accept Jesus
Christ as personal Savior will suffer
punishment here throughout eternity.
(Luke 16:19-31; Revelations 20:11-15)
>We believe that Heaven is the abode
of God, and those who are born again
will spend eternity in this blessed
place. (John 14:1-3; Revelations 21 & 22)
>We believe that the visible church
is a congregation of baptized believers,
practicing New Testament principles,
believing its doctrines, observing its
ordinances, and exercising its
autonomy.
(Matthew 18:15-18; Acts 2:41-42; Acts 20:17-28; Matthew 28:18-20)
>We believe that our Lord gave the
believer two ordinances. They are baptism
by immersion and partaking of the
Lord’s table. (I Corinthians 11:23-30; Matthew 28:19-20)
>We believe that the Scriptures are
clear in the financing of the church
through tithes and offerings of the
members of that local assembly. (Malachi 3:10)

pretribulational return of Christ in the
clouds to receive His Bride.
(I Thessalonians 1:10; 4:16-18; 5:9; I Corinithians 15:51-53; Romans 5:9)
>We believe that it is the privilege
and responsibility of the redeemed to be
a witness by life and word to the
truths of His Word and to proclaim the
gospel to all the world, beginning at
home. We believe that every Christian should
seek to lead others to a saving
knowledge of Christ; that missions is not
only soul winning, but also
discipleship. (Acts 1:8; Matthew 28:19,20)
>We believe in separation from
ecclesiastical heresy and apostasy. (Romans 16:17; II Corinthians 6:14-18)
>We stand opposed to the charismatic
movement, new evangelicalism, and
ecumenical movements.
>The underlying premise of this
ministry is that man’s chief responsibility
is to glorify God and that Jesus Christ
can change the most troubled life to
achieve this responsibility. God can
change our lives so we become the person He
desires
