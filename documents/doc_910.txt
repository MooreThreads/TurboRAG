Self Employed & Contractors
Being self-employed is both rewarding and demanding in equal measure. Ensuring you comply with all current legislation whilst running your own business can be challenging.
We have many self-employed clients and help them in a wide variety of ways including managing their paperwork and making sure they complete all of the correct forms on time, avoiding late filing penalties.
Our services for those of you who are self employed include:
- Business plans and HMRC registration
- Accounting system advice and bookkeeping
- National Insurance Contributions
- VAT registration and returns
- Financial reviews and management accounts
From the construction industry and engineering contractors, to doctors, hairdressers, and many others, we can help you keep your accounts up-to-date and make sure you are running your business in the most tax efficient manner.
At MCC we believe in pro-active assistance rather than just sitting back and waiting for your instructions. Your accountant should be there to advise on best practices, update you on changes to the law and keep you aware of money savings that are available through Government initiatives. We know that if you thrive with our assistance then we will benefit from that so we are always looking to help our clients run their businesses in the best way possible.
If you have any questions or would like to arrange a preliminary meeting please give us a call on 0161 707 1500. We specialise in clients based in Manchester and Salford but work with others across the North West.
