gangbang the fish
>>6203745Send the Zhangs after them
>>6203745By saving Pomu from wageslavery...
>>6203745Hololive rejects? Hololive rejects
>>6203745>weIt's all for them to decide
>>6203745better than Cocock's Reddit memes.
>>6203745First actually funny Vtuber-related meme Iâ€™ve seen from Twitter.
>>6203745Holy fucking kek, this fucking fish.
>>6203745Based feesh
qrd on these discount holos?
>>6203745Why would she retweet this though? Isn't calling Pomu a wageslave putting nijisanji in a bad light?
>>6205107She replies to porn of herself constantly and also made a "we should all graduate" joke during the week of Lulu and Coco. She doesn't give a shit.
>>6203745>>6205107Pomu works full time outside of Nijisanji. Also, someone did SC this at Finana yesterday, but she didn't know how to read it and mispronounced "wagey". Probably someone will try it again now that she's seen the meme rhyme in written form.
>>6205107Pomu being an OL has nothing to do with Nijisanji and everything to do with her upcoming surgeryBesides she's already retweeted this in the past so I doubt they care about whatever she does if it doesn't cause controversy
>>6205067have a qrd off a cliff, fag.
>>6203745you don't
>>6205067Pomu is known to be a wage slave and often laments that she has to work in the morning. Finana and Elira are NEETs.>>6205107Nah. Pomu is the one who complains about being a wageslave.
>>6203745Don't forget domestic violence
>>6204477Fuck off carol
>>6205332>Finana and Elira are NEETs.NijiEN is employment.

>>6205903Absolute Chad
>>6203745There's no end to it. Embrace the bully culture.
Kill them
>>6205249Was the surgery serious or rrat? I know mint used to talk about her healt but idk it warrant any surgery? What's her illness?
>>6203745This will age poorly if the surgery doesn't go well. At least we know who might be about to get canceled.
>>6208731Bad genes, high chance of getting a certain type of cancer so she is getting preventative surgery next month. Has to keep her wage slave job for health insurance for the surgery.
>>6204477Pekora!
>>6205292They are not humanBut im also glad we have nijisanji as a contrast to hololive, rather this than the vshojo creatures
>>6203745Nijisanji is not bully! Nijisanji is wholesome!
>>6204477I'm Pomu? I'm Pomu
>>6203745Looks like they are safely serving polarizing content against globohomo.
>>6204477Double dubs of truth.
>>6205107>nijisanji in a bad light?You were under the impression that Nijisanji had a good reputation?
>>6204477and that's a good thing!
>>6210116It's not an impression, it's a fact.
>>6205903>The post at the end. Gets me every time.
>>6204477>Hololive rejected Pomumistakes were made.
