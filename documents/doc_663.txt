“So as these last 5 months on the farm come to an end within the next 2 days, I’m at a complete loss of words. This has only been the beginning of my journey. Yes, I’ve been living for the past 22 years but it feels like my life has just begun. The future is so bright and it looks so clear and beautiful. Hava ve Adam farm is my home, Israel is my home. So with that said, I’ll be back in the states until August 8th and then its back to Israel for me 🙂 to continue my journey on the farm!”
It’s kind of crazy for me to think about how much has changed in the last year. Exactly one year ago today, the best decision I have ever made in my life began. I stepped foot on the Hava V’Adam Eco-educational farm and with 6 months of adventures ahead of me. I still remember how magical the first day was. Everything on the farm seemed to have this beautiful glow around it – the people, the nature, the domes, and centers on the farm. Even now when I nostalgically remember my days on the farm I can almost feel the warmth of that glow that I felt on that first day. The farm was exactly where I needed to be during that time of my life. It was an opportunity to grow, to learn, to challenge myself, to meet amazing friends and to experience Israel. Not a day goes by since I’ve been back that I don’t think about my time on the farm. I miss it immensely and i am filled with joy when I see updates about what’s going on the farm now. I’m dreaming of the day that I can return!

What makes Hava & Adam, and specifically Eco Israel, so special? True, the farm is gorgeous. True, it’s a blessing to live so healthily and connected with a group of loving humans and nature. True, the organic agriculture on the farm could be upped in intensity and efficiency. But what is at the core of my experience here? It’s all about the awareness and playing with what a fulfilled life means for me. I’ve had the chance to discover this both on the farm and off. (during group trips and weekends)
The first Shabbat on the farm has been amazing. We had a primarily meditative Kabbalat Shabbat and then feasted on homemade challah, lentil patties, curry with rice, as well as a few glasses of wine. We sang songs which I was surprised to hear are known across the world. Music connects us like nothing else!
remember,we bath under the same sun,and sleep under the same moon.we are much close that you think.
I’m doing Eco 13 to deepen my understanding of organic sustainable farming. I am super interested in knowing where my food comes from, and I love the time I spend in the Eco Kitchen. I want to take everything I gain here on the farm with me for the rest of my life .
when you are responsible for a process that you never face in real life -you learn a lot about the unseen part of life/ i grew the most doing this.
“I wouldn’t have traded this semester for absolutely anything. The community here blows my mind. I’ve never loved so many people so much. The encouragement here to work on something you want to achieve makes it easy to motivate. The way I learned to live in a community and what I bring to the table gave me more knowledge about myself than I could’ve dreamed. It’s no secret that this place is a magnet for special people, but I didn’t realize how special until recently. My friends here have helped shape me into the person I want and strive to be. They aren’t afraid to kindly point out what I need to work on and help me get there. But they also make me feel beautiful and confident. Something that had been lacking in my life for a while. They inspire me to be a hard worker and go for what I want. ”

The Eco-Israel program is one of self-discovery and self-empowerment.
I came with the intention of learning enough skills to eventually design and build a community with permaculture-based infrastructure in the future.
Eco-Israel has given me enough knowledge, confidence and skills to know where to start making mistakes while encouraging me to cultivate the awareness to identify and fix them along the way.
Hava & Adam is a peaceful place full of peaceful people in one of the most contentious places on the planet. I’m grateful to have had my “living in Israel” experience here.”

Most challenging thing about living on the farm: knowing that one day I will have to leave it.

I came to Eco Israel to learn more about permaculture in a hands-on way, but I also gained a lot of unexpected things from the program. One of the best parts of Eco Israel was living in a community and figuring out the best ways to strengthen that community. Spending the past 5 months together working, eating, communicating, and having fun united our group. The community also taught me a lot about myself and helped me to grow in ways I didn’t know were possible. Besides community, my favorite part of Eco Israel was living on Hava & Adam. Living in such a beautiful farm surrounded by nature has clarified the life I want to live, being connected to the Earth and helping others to enjoy the beautiful and bountiful world that we live in to its fullest potential!

“Doing this program was the best decision I ever made. I not only proved to everyone that I am strong, but most importantly, I proved it to myself. I’ve learned lifelong skills and learned more about myself that I could have ever imagined. I am proud of myself for making it through, even though I’ve wanted to give up many times. The people that went through this journey with me, and the support I got from home, is what kept me going, and I’d like to thank each and every one of them for helping me through it. This experience has changed me for the better, not just for now, but forever. ”
