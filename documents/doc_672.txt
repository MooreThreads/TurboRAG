The journey has begun. One that will take me through space and time to speak with the Healers, Elders and Ancient Ones. Seeking those who walk among us quietly doing the work that has been set forth so that the Stories and Traditions may be remembered. Allowing our Young Ones to learn all is sacred. This is a time of shared knowledge, information that has been held by the keepers of the gate so that when the time came to pass, it would once again be shared. I believe we are at that moment in time. It is my honor to not only record this information but share it with all that seek its wisdoms. On the following pages you will hear stories and get to know the people I have met along this journey.. It is their stories that give my words life. And it is their wisdoms that will teach us all.
I believe many have forgotten what life is truly about and that we all need to wake up to the world around us. It is my hopes that all that read these stories, remember that they to can make a difference. It is time…time for a simpler way…so come and take a walk with me, take A walk with the bear.
Have a prayer request, House Blessing you would like to have done or other things, need some custom work done, or questions about the work I do… feel free to contact me here and I will respond as soon as possible. You can also use it to get the newsletter and totem guide I will be sending out each month!
