The Cracchiolo Law Library of the James E. Rogers College of Law and the University of Arizona School of Information offer a Fellowship in Law Librarianship for lawyers seeking to become law librarians. The Fellowship program began in 2001 and our graduates have been placed in law school, university, court, and law firm libraries across the country.
Fellows work 20 hours a week in the law library in a variety of professional roles while attending the University of Arizona's School of Information, obtaining their M.L.I.S. degree. The salary is $13,000 per year and includes full university benefits (health care, sick and vacation days, etc.) and tuition remission. Fellows have up to two years to complete the program, but most complete it in a year and a half. It is also possible to graduate in as little as one calendar year.
Acceptance into the Fellowship depends upon acceptance into the School of Information program, which applicants must apply to separately. Please visit the University of Arizona Careers website at for additional information.
