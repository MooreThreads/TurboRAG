Real Life Color Coach Color of the Week: Real Red
The Hue of the Red Color Group is Real Red – a color that always makes me think of Christmas. Of course, a lot of people think of Valentine’s Day too, but I’m an old married lady with grandchildren, so Christmas comes first. Real Red has a companion in Pink Pirouette, the Tint, but Pink Pirouette is definitely more Valentine’s than Christmas! Pink Pirouette makes cute Winter cards with snowflakes or even penguins and snowmen (I’ll show you in a few weeks), but Real Red is the rich, bright color of Christmas. It’s festive!
I love Real Red paired with the Gold Foil Sheets. Silver Foil works as well, but I had the Gold Foil out. I really appreciate that Stampin’ Up!® put out the 1/8” Metallic Ribbon in both colors. Gold is, as I’ve mentioned before, a Neutral color, so the Monochromatic Color Scheme of Real Red and Gold works just fine!
The Delicate Ornaments Thinlits™ Dies look fantastic in the Foil. I adore the lacy look. I had fun enhancing the laciness of this card with the Curvy Corner Trio Punch. The ornament could be made removable, but I tied the ribbon so it just dangles. If you want to make an ornament to hang up, do it simply by die-cutting two Red Foil solid ornament shapes and adhering them back to back, then adhere the lacy Gold ornament to one side. Use the Fine-Tip Glue Pen on the lace and work quickly because the glue dries fairly fast. The glue also dries shiny so it looks great on the Foil. By the way, the Red Foil Sheets are very close in color to Real Red, which is why I didn’t make an ornament from my card front decoration. I wanted the Card Stock to show through.
Real Red Monochrome combinations are great for Christmas, Valentine’s Day, Red Hat Day, and other high-powered or festive occasions. Real Red with Basic Black, Early Espresso or Chocolate Chip gives a very sophisticated feel and is great for formal party and dinner invitations. Use with Whisper White for Cheer Up and Birthday cards. Real Red is also great for Christmas, Valentine’s or vacation pages!
