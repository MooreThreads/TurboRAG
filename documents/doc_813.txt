CD64 distinguishes macrophages from dendritic cells in the gut and reveals the Th1-inducing role of mesenteric lymph node macrophages during colitis.
- Samira Tamoutounour, Sandrine Henri, +13 authors Martin Guilliams
- European journal of immunology

Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MΦs) are key components of intestinal immunity. However, the lack of surface markers differentiating MΦs from DCs has hampered understanding of… (More)
Regulation of dendritic cell development by GM-CSF: molecular control and implications for immune homeostasis and therapy.

Dendritic cells (DCs) represent a small and heterogeneous fraction of the hematopoietic system, specialized in antigen capture, processing, and presentation. The different DC subsets act as sentinels… (More)
Transactivation of classical and nonclassical HLA class I genes through the IFN-stimulated response element.

Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells seems to be a prerequisite to prevent the development of autoimmunity. Here we identify that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-driven macrophages… (More)
Viral load reduction improves activation and function of natural killer cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

BACKGROUND & AIMS Natural killer (NK) cells play a major role in anti-viral immunity as first line defense and regulation of virus-specific T cell responses. This study aimed to investigate phenotype… (More)
The effect of calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids on the differentiation of human dendritic cells.
- Andrea M. Woltman, J. W. de Fijter, Sylvia W A Kamerling, LeendertC. Paul, Mohamed R. Daha, Cees van Kooten
- European journal of immunology
- 2000
Corticosteroids and the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 have been studied extensively regarding their effects on T lymphocytes, but their effects on dendritic cells (DC) are… (More)
Polymorphisms near IL28B and serologic response to peginterferon in HBeAg-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B.

Rapamycin induces apoptosis in monocyte- and CD34-derived dendritic cells but not in monocytes and macrophages.
- Andrea M. Woltman, J. W. de Fijter, +4 authors Cees van Kooten
- Blood

Rapamycin (Rapa), a recently introduced immunosuppressive drug, seems to be effective in preventing acute allograft rejection. Although its antiproliferative effect on T lymphocytes has been… (More)

Dendritic cells (DCs) and complement are essential components of the innate immune system. Immature DCs (immDCs) and mature DCs (mDCs) can migrate to lymphoid areas inducing, respectively, tolerance… (More)

Globally, over 500 million people are chronically infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). These chronic infections cause liver inflammation, and may result in… (More)
