The MLB is back in action on Friday evening as the Cincinnati Reds will clash with Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field in Chicago, in game one of a three-game series. The Reds will give the nod to Tyler Mahle and the Cubs will counter with Mike Montgomery.
Cincinnati Reds Form
The Cincinnati Reds are enjoying a solid form at the moment and that can be seen through their recent results. The Reds are heading into this game having won 16 of their last 22 games and it seems that their offensive firepower is finally at the right track as they have dominated in recent games. However, they need to bounce back as they lost their last game against the White Sox with a score of 7-4. The Reds have averaged 4.38 runs per game and have allowed 4.85 runs per game on the road so far this year. Tyler Mahle record against the Cubs stands at 1-1 with 3.00 ERA in two starts. This will be his first start at Wrigley Field.
On the offensive side of the game, the Reds have solid stats as they are placed on the 8th place in the league in scoring, putting up 4.68 runs per game, while also being 6th in hitting at .256 and 20th place in homers with a total of 92 so far this season. On the mound, they have been in a poor form this season as they are placed on the 25th spot in the league in ERA at 4.65, while also being 27th in WHIP at 1.41 and 23rd place in K’s with 681.
Chicago Cubs Form
The Chicago Cubs are unstoppable at the moment they are on a run of six wins in a row. They are heading into this game as they beat the Tigers in the last game with a score of 5-2. They will need to keep that pace against a resurgent Reds team if they want to stay at the top spot in the National League Central. The Cubs had an average start of the season but they quickly improved and now it seems that they are one of the top guns in the Majors. Chicago has averaged 5.20 runs per game and has allowed 4.12 runs per game here at home for the year so far.
Mike Montgomery record against the Reds stands at 1-1 with a 3.38 ERA in 14 games (four starts). Montgomery is 6-4 with a 3.88 ERA in 43 games (12 starts) at Wrigley in his career.
On the offensive side of the game, the Cubs are on the 3rd spot in the league in scoring, putting up 5.12 runs per game, while also being 1st in hitting at .266 and 19th place in homers with a total of 93 so far. On the mound, they are on the 6th place in the league in ERA at 3.56, while also being placed on the 16th spot in WHIP at 1.32 and 2nd in K’s with 705.
Both of these two teams are in good form at the moment and my expectation is that we will see a very interesting game. The Reds are constantly improving and their offence is very solid at the moment. On the other side, the Cubs have six wins in a row and they are involved in a tight race with the Brewers for the top spot in the National Central Divison. And although the Reds are hot right now, I expect that the Cubs will get the 7th win in the last 7 games. Go for the Cubs in this one.
