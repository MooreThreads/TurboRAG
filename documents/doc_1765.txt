The Wauneta-Palisade FFA chapter held its annual banquet Tuesday, April 22.
Speaker Spencer Hartman of Imperial, who recently finished his term as president of Nebraska FFA, spoke to attendees about potential.
Using the analogy of the FFA jacket, Hartman said the jacket itself has little possibility until the student puts it on. The possibilities then become endless as is the student given the opportunities and encouragement.
Led by outgoing president Landon Jutten, guests enjoyed a meal and witnessed the presentation of degrees and awards, as well as the installation of new officers.
Officers for 2014-2015 will be Nicole Strand, president; Cameo Rector, vice president; Ellie Lee, secretary; Lesley Towery, treasurer; Stephanie Acosta, reporter; Billy Straub, sentinel; Joseph Sramek, officer at large; and Cody Barrett, historian.
