I want to try something different. From here on out (October 2nd, 2012), pieces published in other arenas will simply have the title, date, venue, and a link posted here. My hope is to keep the site a little more tidy. Maybe it'll work, maybe it won't; we'll see.

Note: The views I express on Kent Issue 11, 2012 are the voted upon
views of Kent Environmental Council, for whom I am the current chair.
My views run contrary to those of the group, and I personally do not
support Issue 11, but in a capacity as representative of the group, I am
bound to represent their position, no matter what my own might be.
