A pandemic is a worldwide outbreak of disease which may affect many people
- Public health experts are concerned that a pandemic flu (influenza) could break out in the United States.
- During severe flu pandemics in the past, 25% - 35% of the world’s population was infected and many people died.
The.
- Pandemic flu may be a threat when a new strain of influenza virus spreads in humans. Influenza outbreaks are common in humans and some animals such as birds and pigs. New virus strains may start in humans or may start in animals and then spread to humans.
- One example of a new flu virus spreading in humans began in the spring of 2009 when cases of human infection with a new swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus were first reported in Mexico and then found across the United States and internationally.
- Flu in humans can vary in severity from mild to severe. Some people may have difficulty fighting off the infection because the new virus is different from the flu viruses that made people sick during previous flu seasons. In addition, prior flu vaccinations may or may not provide protection against a new flu strain.
A pandemic flu would have a major impact on all of our lives
- A pandemic flu may spread very easily and rapidly throughout the region, the state and the entire country. A quarter of the population (25%) could be affected.
- A severe pandemic flu could cause many deaths. While some pandemics are relatively mild, we need to be prepared for a serious outbreak.
- The health care system could be overwhelmed, and places you rely on – like government offices, stores, schools, transportation and other services – may not be available.
