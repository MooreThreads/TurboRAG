Islander Takes A Peek At East Oahu’s Prep Football Prospects
With the release of the 2014 OIA slate, MidWeek‘s East Oahu Islander breaks down the respective schedules for Anuenue, Kalani and Kaimuki in the White conference as well as Division I Kaiser. (The Cougars were promoted after winning the OIA White as well as the DII state title last November.)
Anuenue Na Koa
2013 record: 0-9 overall, 0-8 in OIA White
2014 games: Waimea (at Kamehameha) Aug. 9, Radford (at Roosevelt) Aug. 15, Kaimuki (at Kaiser) Aug. 23, Kalani (at Kaiser) Aug. 29, at Pearl City Sept. 5, Kalaheo (at Kailua) Sept. 13, at Nanakuli Sept. 19, at Roosevelt Sept. 26, Waialua (at Kaiser) Oct. 4.
Key stretch: Pearl City, Kalaheo, Nanakuli
Must-see game 1: Kalani Must-see game 2: Waialua Game to be on upset-alert for: Roosevelt
Schedule breakdown: Having a bye in week nine could be an asset, as a week off just before the playoffs can help Anuenue prepare for the post-season. Road trips to Pearl City and Nanakuli appear to be the meat of the schedule. The good news is that Anuenue won’t have to travel to Radford, as the playing field is at Roosevelt.
Kalani Falcons
2013 record: 6-4 overall, 6-2 in OIA White
2014 games: Waialua (at Kaiser) Aug. 16, Kalaheo (at Kailua) Aug. 23, Anuenue (at Kaiser) Aug. 29, at Roosevelt Sept. 5, Radford (at Kaiser) Sept. 12, Kaimuki (at Kaiser) Sept. 20, at Pearl City Oct. 3, Nanakuli (at Kaiser) Oct. 11.
Key stretch: Radford, Kaimuki, Pearl City
Must-see game 1: Kaimuki
Must-see game 2: Pearl City
Game to be on upset-alert for: Anuenue
Schedule breakdown: With winnable games in succession against Waialua, Kalaheo, Anuenue and Roosevelt, there’s a chance for a nice run by the Falcons over the season’s first month. The road gets bumpier on the back end of the slate with tough games against Radford, Pearl City and Nanakuli.
Kaimuki Bulldogs
2013 record: 1-7 overall, 0-6 in OIA Red East
2014 schedule: Anuenue (at Kaiser) Aug. 23, at Pearl City Aug. 29, Radford (at Kaiser) Sept. 6, at Nanakuli Sept. 13, Kalani (at Kaiser) Sept. 20, at Waialua Sept. 26, Kalaheo (at Kaiser) Oct. 3, at Roosevelt Oct. 10
Key stretch: Pearl City, Radford, Nanakuli
Must-see game 1: Kalani Must-see game 2: Radford Game to be on upset-alert for: Waialua
Schedule breakdown: For Kaimuki, the difference between a good and a great season may be tied to how well it performs in true road games at Pearl City, Nanakuli, Waialua and Roosevelt. Weeks two and three also will be demanding with Pearl City and Radford back to back.
Kaiser Cougars
2013 record: 13-1 overall, 7-1 in OIA White
2014 games: Aiea Aug. 15, Waianae Aug. 22, Waipahu Sept. 5, McKinley (at Roosevelt) Sept. 12, Kahuku Sept. 19, at Castle Sept. 26, at Leilehua Oct. 3.
Key stretch: Kahuku, Castle, Leilehua
Must-see game 1: Kahuku Must-see game 2: Waianae Game to be on upset-alert for: Waipahu
Schedule breakdown: The back end of the slate is as demanding as any team in the OIA with a home date against Kahuku and road games against Castle and Leilehua to close out the season. Kaiser also will open its home schedule with a flourish with back-to-back games against Aiea and Waianae.
