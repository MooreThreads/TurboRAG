OP- Something different by Veleven
This one is certainly different, that's for sure. It was born out of a drawing day at *Pink-Foxx's house, while she worked on a project on Photoshop and I worked by hand on this. Have to say I wasn't feeling particularly well that day. I think I just wanted to try something... well.. different. And different it is. It's wonky, strange and every member of the Straw Hats look like they've each come down with some sort of illness, but overall it's rather interesting. I promised I'd submit this so here it is.. enjoy, yo!
