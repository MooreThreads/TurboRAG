Buy remanufactued and save!
This remanfactured rifle comes with a 30 day gunner, but a serious hunter, the 350 will sharpen your skills in the off-season and allow you to practice your trigger control for that big hunt. It is a great addition to any gun collection. These magnum+ Airguns do require a little more attention to detail when making scope and pellet selection.
