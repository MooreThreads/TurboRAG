The restoration took 7 months but time was well spent! Even when it is true that you will find a lot of non-USA delivery Land Cruisers for sale; it is also true that not only non-USA delivery Land Cruisers don’t meet US standards, but parts are difficult to find.The body was removed from the frame and the motor was serviced along with the transmission and brake system. Master cylinder, slave cylinder, brake disks, brake drums, and window seals were also replaced, all gauges were fully restored and serviced as well. All glass windows were fully polished, and all exterior bolts are stainless steel. I have made the decision to keep the original color and the classic pinstripes. This classic comes with new fenders, new shocks, 4 speed transmission and new clutch were installed. This Land Cruiser even has power steering and A/C! Don’t make the mistake of buying a historic Land Cruiser that you will not be able to enjoy due to the lack of parts. Please do your research and don’t waste your time or mine...These amazing cars hold their value very well. If you have any questions please ask. Contact Manny after 6pm 214 243 0737
