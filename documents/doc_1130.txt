Ingredients
- 1 1/2 pounds salmon fillet, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 8 makrut lime leaves
- 4 stalks lemongrass
- 4 small shallots, peeled ans sliced thinly lengthwise (about 1/2 cup)
- 3 to 4 Thai bird's eye chilies, or 1 to 2 jalapeño peppers, thinly sliced
- 1/4 fish sauce, or more to taste
- 3 to 4 tablespoons fresh juice from about 3 limes
- 1 cup loosely packed mint leaves
Directions
- 1.
Bring 6 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Meanwhile, remove tough center vein from lime leaves. Stack trimmed leave together and roll tightly into a scroll. Slice as thinly as possible. Set aside. Remove tough outer leaves from lemongrass, trim off bottom, then thinly slice into rounds, stopping when purple inner leaves end and stalk starts to become fibrous.
- 2.
Lower heat to lowest setting (water should be barely quivering and register between 160 and 180°F on an instant read thermometer). Gently lower salmon into water and give a gently stir. Cook just until exteriors are opaque, about 1 minute. Immediately lift with a spider or slotted spoon and transfer to a large plate lined with paper towels to drain.
- 3.
Transfer salmon to a medium mixing bowl. Season to taste with fish sauce and lime juice. Salad should be predominantly sour, then salty. Add lemongrass, shallots, and chilies. Transfer mixture to serving platter. Top with lime leaves and mint leaves. Serve immediately.
