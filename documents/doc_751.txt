One weekend my husband recorded a movie that he thought I might like. The movie, Martian Child, starred John Cussack as a recently widowed man who debates going through an adoption that he and his wife had initiated before her death.
In the movie, John Cusack and his newly adopted son, Dennis, work at learning how to live with one another, how to communicate and how to heal their own tender hearts. Dennis believes he is from Mars, hence the title. For Dennis his Martian background is why he has been abandonded by his family. The movie is a lovely story about these two different characters who grow to discover who they are and the family they can make together.
David Gerrold is an award winning writer. He won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards for this book. He has also written for Star Trek, Sliders, Babylon 5, and The Twilight Zone. His other novels include The Man Who Folded Himself and When HARLIE Was One.
The Martian Child, novel is semi-autobiographical. The movie has taken licence and the characters are not the same as in the movie, but they are just as interesting, still capturing your heart.
I don't know which is better, the book or the movie. John Cusack and Bobby Coleman have a wonderful chemistry as father and son. On the other hand, Gerrold's writing is lyrical and really captures the imagination. I guess I'd have to say that this is the case where you want to read the book and watch the movie...even if they are somewhat different.
