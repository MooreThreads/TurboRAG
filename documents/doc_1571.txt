6 months deep...
Started at 168-Sitting at 180
First Pic is a ****ty one, i didn't see bb as a future life choice. This pic i drank every weekend, ate ****ty and did limited exercise
then these are most recent after chest day- i now drink maybe once a month, eat clean 28 out of 30 days, gains are slow but happening.
Just the beginning.

quick question regarding calories, i wanna get them up but dont want the pudge effect, what foods are good for that? ive heard pop tarts haha
03-26-2009, 02:28 PM
Pop Tarts?! Lol
Stick with clean foods, alot of protein... cook a bunch of chicken breasts, make sure to get your greens hearts of romaine lettuce, broccoli, clean carbs such as oatmeal
Pop Tarts definitely not a clean source of food ha... lots of sugar

Keep it up bro! I personally dont find whole eggs to be detrimental unless you are SERIOUSLY downing cartons at a time or cutting hardcore
