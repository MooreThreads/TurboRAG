Football hooligans from for instance Europe will not be able to come to South Africa during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Home Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma affirmed during a press conference on Tuesday.
She said an advance passenger processing system was put in place to bar such people from entering South Africa. South Africa in this respect is working closely together with the authorities of countries that have a history of hooliganism, such as the UK, The Netherlands, and Germany.
“The advanced passenger processing [APP] system allows us to bar undesirable elements from entering South Africa before boarding from various countries,” she said.
In addition, the department of Home Affairs will work together with Interpol, international travel agencies and FIFA to monitor for the possible entry of soccer hooligans. It is said that 79 percent of all airlines flying to South Africa during 2010 have pledged their cooperation.
