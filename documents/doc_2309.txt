Situated in North Central Wyoming at the foothills of the Big Horn Mountains, Sheridan is the ideal location to establish a day or a lifetime of memories. From museums, historical battlegrounds and art galleries, to rodeos and polo, Sheridan has a spot for you. Sheridan County has a population of 26,560 with the majority of the population, 15,804, living in Historic Sheridan, Wyoming.
The area's abundant wildlife creates a perfect backdrop for hiking, camping, fishing, mountain biking, skiing and snowmobiling. Prefer a scenic view? Try hang gliding from Sand Turn on Highway 14, your gateway to Yellowstone and Teton National Parks.
