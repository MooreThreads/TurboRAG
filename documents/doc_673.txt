As if I haven‚Äôt been busy enough with client work and workshops, over the past few weeks I have been planning the details of a little trip down to Sonoma/Napa. I will be flying down to SF on Friday October 24th and driving up to Sonoma Valley to do photography for some private clients near Santa Rosa on Saturday the 25th at a small estate winery.
I will be in California for 7 days, mainly for some long-overdue R&R, but have set aside the entire weekend for client photography.
If you or someone you know lives in the area (SF, Sonoma, Napa, Greater San Francisco Bay area), and is interested in scheduling a session with me on the 25th or 26th of October, please send me an email and let me know. I am taking a *very* limited number of sessions while there so that I can have a Sonoma-in-the-fall-induced zen-like calm color every day that I am there.
**Please note that ALL sessions will be done in or near Santa Rosa, Sonoma or Napa.**
Oh, and lest you think you need to sell a kidney or something to work with me, this totally isn‚Äôt the case! üôÇ
Every client whose dog I photograph will receive a super cool little gift that is only for my most special clients- something that I don‚Äôt release to the general public. Oooh, I can‚Äôt wait.

I am more excited about this trip than words can express and I can‚Äôt wait to see the resulting shots of dogs among the fall colored grapes and vines and beautiful rolling hills of Sonoma. Also SO looking forward to taking some time off and relaxing. I have been working hard on my business non-stop for years and it‚Äôs time for a little break. Sipping wine on a picnic blanket under a tree sounds like heaven to me. A good girlfriend is flying down from Seattle with me and we will be renting a convertible at the airport and driving up to the wine country. Cannot Wait!! You can bet I will be sharing photos here after I return.
Some images I have been using for inspiration:
