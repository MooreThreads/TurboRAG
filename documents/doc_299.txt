Things are fully back in swing after the Easter break, thanks to Gorilla Sports, let’s catch you up on what’s taken place around the grounds.
NPL
Brisbane Strikers had plenty of opportunities to put the game to bed earlier than they did, resulting in some nervous moments for their supporters. They came away with a 4-0 victory though with goals to Rhys Meredith, Greig Henslee, Trent Clulow and Alistair Davis. Match report –
FNQ Heat have the bragging rights in the Northern Derby coming away 4-1 winners over the Northern Fury. Heat remain top of the table after a double from Jamie Carroll and singles to Kieran Sanders and Darcy McCormack.
Western Pride recorded their second win in a row in somewhat of an upset 4-2 win over Brisbane City who ended the match with nine men. After Pride took a 2-0 lead into the break, City came back to level shortly after the hour mark but Pride were able to regain the ascendency in the final fifteen minutes to claim the three points.
BRISBANE PREMIER LEAGUE
Crazy times out at Redcliffe with Peninsula Power opening the scoring in the first minute. Power scoring another two times before the half hour mark against Capalaba. The Bulldogs then fought back converting two penalties before halftime. After five goals in the first half, there were none in the second. Power coming away 3-2 winners.
Lions claimed a 2-1 victory against Albany Creek. Kenya Takahashi and Peter Gaffney scored for the visitors while Kristen Waters was the Albany Creek scorer.
Three first-half goals to Holland Park set them up for a 4-1 win over Logan Lightning. Worryingly for the Hawks though was the send-off of striker Marek Madle, potentially leaving them without valuable firepower in the coming weeks. Madle scoring a brace, Dan Smith and Travis Jackson scored for the Hawks, Pepi Kostovski for Logan.
Two goals from leading scorer Carter Glockner saw Easts good form continue defeating Rochedale 3-0. Ramone Close scored the other goal.
