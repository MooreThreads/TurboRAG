When using night depositories
Observe the area before making your deposit. Try to bring someone with you when using the night deposit after dark. If you notice anything suspicious, leave without making a deposit. Then report it to the police. Deposit just one bag at a time; that s all most night depositories are built to handle. Don t resist if you are approached; remember everything you can about the person and call the police immediately. If you have a cell phone, bring it with you. And if you ever do see anything suspicious at any of our ATM or night depository locations, report it to the police immediately by calling 911. Please take a few seconds to observe the area and always exercise caution so that you can safely enjoy the many time saving benefits of our 24 hour banking services.
