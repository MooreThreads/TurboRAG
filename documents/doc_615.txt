LUNCH POLICIES
Students should come to school each day with a healthy lunch and drink following our peanut free policy. Approximately one half hour is allotted each day for lunch and recess. For safety reasons, containers and bottles brought to school should not be made of glass.
If you would like your child to eat the lunch you have provided for them, please make it clear to your child that they should not trade lunches with other students. Students will not have use of kitchen facilities (microwave, refrigerator) so please keep this in mind when you are packing your child's lunch.
* non-breakable water bottles are permitted during class time
PEANUT FREE POLICY
Students are asked to bring lunches and snacks free of peanuts and products that may contain peanuts, such as donuts, granola bars, etc. We ask you to read food labels, checking for peanut ingredients prior to sending food to school. This is a life saving measure.
