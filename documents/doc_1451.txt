AMERICAN PURE WHEY 100% Whey protein matrix, chocolate Review
By
Matt Morgan
USES:
I usually use this protein with my meals the slower digesting whey concentrate is perfect for a steady feed of protein threw the day.
My preferred methods of this is to add it to oatmeal with a scoop of peanut butter this is a prefect meal with a lean protein source complex carbs and healthy fats.
I also will add it to pancake mix or waffle mix.
It is also very good before a workout to keep a steady stream of amino acids fueling your muscle and keeping you from entering a catabolic state during your workout.
It can also be used post workout but i would give whey isolate a sligh edge here.
So i would recommend a whey concentrate over isolate as a throughout the day protein source since it last longer in your system the only three times id use an isolate over it is first thing when i wake up, post workout two times when the faster digesting and acting isolate is better and if you are lactose intolerant.
Rating: Profile 10/10
You wont find a whey concentrate with a better profile.
Taste 8.5/10
I prefer the cinnamon bun over this but it is still very good if your a chocolate lover which i am not.
Mixablity 10/10
Nearly instantly completely dissolves whether you add it to milk water or even pancake mix and oatmeal.
Cost 10/10
Blows away the compation especially if you buy 20 to 50 lbs like i do. Conclusion: Great tasting and mixing protein for daily protein replacement and needs i highly recommend it and use it myself daily to help me reach my 300 gram a day protein needs.
