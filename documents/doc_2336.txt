Park your car in the parking lot. If you are not a local I suggest you park far away. Be careful if it's a strong NW swell and you are trying to get into shore. Smaller days are real fun, but with some size, watch out.
Atmosphere
Beautiful and one of the best waves in Nor cal. Very rocky, but one of the funnest right reef breaks around.
General
I love this spot. Even though I live in So cal now, this is still one of my favorite waves around. Don't piss the locals off and don't tell your friends and you should be ok. Have respect and you will get respected. Only surf here if you are experienced.

This isn't Mistos, Mystos, or Miss Cameltoes at all! - The spot's true name is Sonoma Coast State Beach, off the Myers grade road & PCH@Seaview Community. Just pay the park's usage fee for as much as you wanna surf here!!
Mistos - It's an OK wave but why drive by the River Mouth and The Grade. If you're gonna drive that far why not just go the extra 30 to Mendo? There's easily a dozen better waves between Gualala and
- all you fags go back to sac, none of you guys can surf or deserve any respect. go to a shitty beach break to learn how to surf.
