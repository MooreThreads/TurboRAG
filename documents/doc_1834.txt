Mobile phones and wearable devices are changing marketing. Brands struggle to interact with their audiences in real-time across all of these devices and create relevant marketing campaigns. Digital marketing is impacted by new technologies and strategies. Businesses must be thoughtful if they want to be innovators in marketing.
Putting all your efforts into a new technology is probably a mistake. For businesses, this means incorporating new technology that allows for more targeted and fruitful contact with customers. Realize how you can adapt and welcome new opportunities. Examine the impact of some digital marketing technologies and trends expected to grow in the coming years.
Marketing on the Go
Most forward-thinking companies have addressed the need for mobile-friendly site design. However, there is much room for improvement. Why use mobile digital ads?
Studies show that retail conversion rates on smartphones are lower than on desktops. As a business owner, you should still focus on mobile conversion. Though mobile users search first on their phones, they frequently buy on computers. That is, mobile conversions are still important.
Mobile has a significant impact on search marketing because Google prioritizes mobile-friendly experiences. The needs of mobile users must be understood when developing websites.
Marketing Automation
Marketers must now use automated solutions. Marketing automation can help businesses streamline, automate, and measure processes. It improves operational efficiency and provides data for digital marketing operations. Streamlining processes like segmentation, lead generation, content marketing, client retention, and ROI tracking can help your company succeed. Now you just need to decide which marketing technology or automation software will work best for you.
Marketing on Social Media
Nonstop entertainment and instant communication are now expected. Businesses are interested in social media because of its reach and variety of ways to engage audiences. Social media marketing is becoming more popular. Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook are thriving in terms of usability and growth. Despite social media platforms’ attempts to monetize, businesses may have to pay to have influence.
Tailored Content
A campaign isn’t complete without content. Content evolves with online marketing. Personalization is an important aspect of creating content that connects and converts. Marketers believe that personalizing the web experience is critical to current and future success. The goal of every campaign should be to be as unique as possible. Customized content keeps customers coming back and is why digital marketing works.
Video Marketing
Cisco predicts that video traffic will quadruple between 2015 and 2020. Businesses that focus on video marketing are more likely to succeed in the future. Utilizing compelling video content across multiple platforms will help you attract more visitors and convert them.
Without a doubt, technology will continue to change how we market online. Marketing methods will continue to evolve to help businesses better connect with customers. To achieve long-term growth and a higher return on investment, you as a business owner must focus on creative marketing strategies.
Advertising with AI
A component of upcoming web advertising technology, but not widespread or well-known enough to be relevant to most advertising clients. “I don’t hear clients asking about it; it’s irrelevant to them,” is a common refrain in the advertising industry. Despite this, tech giants like Microsoft and retailers like Nordstrom are embracing AI-based advertising. According to a Microsoft report, improved CTR calculation accuracy has a significant impact on user search experience and financial revenue. An extra 0.1% accuracy would result in hundreds of millions of dollars, they claim.
Google, Alibaba, and Amazon have all launched AI and big data initiatives. It’s simple: too much good data doesn’t translate into valuable, usable, and revenue-generating insights. We can be confident that AI is improving internet advertising through predictive programming and analysis.
Predictive Programming
In terms of online advertising technology, predictive programming is a compelling example. This method collects and analyzes internet usage data from individual users. Where a user goes online, what they do there, how long they stay there, what they click or look at online, and how they get there.
This generates a lot of useful data that can be used to create more engaging, relevant, and efficient online advertising. Predictive programming is similar to re-targeting on the surface, but it is far more intricate and finely tuned. Retargeting is a highly effective ad strategy, but it has several flaws. Imagine being re-targeted after receiving a guitar strap as a gift. Predictive programming, on the other hand, does not rely on a single transaction or internet visit to serve ads.
