Iowa Legislature
(02/27/08)
The drive from Lake View to Des Moines on Monday was better than advertised. White outs from blowing snow and icy winter driving conditions were mostly in the rear view mirror as I exited Glidden to the east. Highways 30, 169, and 141 were cleared. The remaining trip to the Capitol was pleasantly uneventful at near speed limit pace. I still believe those 55 mile per hour signs should be adjusted to reflect a little closer to the speed Iowans are actually traveling on our primary road system...

Mini Editorial
(02/27/08)
The Storm Lake city government's plan for a North Lake Avenue "pedestrian trail" - that's a fancy term for sidewalk - is both practical and necessary from a safety standpoint. Thanks to matching funds and a wise two-phase approach, it is financially do-able. Local citizens will see the need and not kick to hard over the expenditure...
