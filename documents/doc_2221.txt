The 1966 stamp featuring Regimental Cap Badge is one of the last stamps of Bechuanaland Protectorate.
The Bechuanaland Protectorate was a protectorate established on 31 March 1885, by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in southern Africa that lasted from 1888 until 1966. The Bechuanaland Protectorate used overprinted stamps from other colonies at first, but in 1932 began using its very own stamps.
The 35 c stamp issued on 1st June 1966 honours Regimental cap badge. In the British Army (as well as Commonwealth armies) each regiment and corps has its own cap badge. The cap badge of the Queen's Royal Lancers is called a motto by those within the regiment.
The stamp depicts the badge on the left on the background of red and green (similar of the colours of the flag of the Bechuanaland pioneer army corps. On the other hand the right depicts bust of Queen Elizabeth along with the image of the Royal Crown.
The Bechuanaland Protectorate became the Republic of Botswana on 30 September 1966.
