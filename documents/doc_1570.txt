Hi guys! Updating my blog for today! Just had a swim earlier and it‚Äôs been a long time since I had one. Enjoying our new home here in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and everything is so good since we arrived here and totally enjoying it. We‚Äôre trying to plan a lot of exploration in this country and so far we have all the good foods we can get just a stone away from Suria KLCC. It‚Äôs been raining here ever since we moved in to the new house but not a big deal at all. It‚Äôs making the weather more friendly for us since we‚Äôre staying on a higher floor unit, We can get all the good breeze from the balconies going inside our house. Don‚Äôt really need much of Fans or Lights. So might guess that our electricity bill is fine hehe.

Apology for not updating that much in my blog. I am trying to edit all my pictures already so when I get to have time to get some internet I can manage to upload them and blog about it. As far as I know our Internet connection will be fixed this coming thursday. So hopefully everyone‚Äôs gonna be happy with a good internet around the house plus good channels on TV! We‚Äôve been trying to watch all the movies we have every night just to kill time. We‚Äôre living in the city so just you guys know that 12midnight is the early start for clubs and bars around.

I‚Äôve been to KL also and I find the people there nice and down to earth, they‚Äôre just like Filipinos in some ways. One of my cousin also lives there with her family for more than 10 years or so and she didn‚Äôt have encountered much difficulty in adjusting to their culture just like how you enjoyed your new environment.
Watch out for my next posts cause I‚Äôll be featuring my adventures in KL.
oh sure dear!! i would love to read your post! actually i‚Äôve encountered few bad things happened with the locals here‚Ä¶ though i judge everyone i know most of them are still good at heart thank you! xx
You really look tall here. Just like Ann said, perfect to be a model.

You are so pretty Mary Jane. You can be a model. Merry Christmas!
