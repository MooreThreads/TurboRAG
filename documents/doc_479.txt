A decent, good-looking choice for occasional use, but the HD50s don't do justice to DVDs and bass-heavy music.

rather impressed with the item however the fact that the alarm volume is uncontrolable, is extremely annoying since this was the major reason for purchasing this product.
Pros: looks good and has a decent speaker for a clock radio
Cons: the alarm volume

- Looks good
- Ipod sits well and charges

- Speaker quality poor

This is exactly what I was looking for. Slim, reasonable sound (it's a clock radio not a sound system) and it takes all iPod versions hat I know of.
Pros: Takes most (all?) iPods
Good sound
Simple to use
Remote control
Cons: Bright display

The back light is too bright. It lights up the room at night and can't be dimmed.
Pros: Tidy little unit
Cons: Bright back light. Impossible to sleep with.

I've been searching for a nice 'clock-radio' which incorporates iPod docking. The TDK looked the goods but for one major flaw. When the radio turns on (in alarm mode) the volume level ramps up (nice feature) BUT you cannot set how loud it gets! It just keeps getting louder and louder. No amount of pressing the volume control (or any other buttons for that matter) will stop it getting too loud. The only way to stop it is to turn it off! Mightily inconvenient if you just want the radio to turn on at a nice moderate level so you can listen to the morning news ..
Pros: - nice styling.
-'inverse' backlit LCD display (doesn't light up the room like most 'normal' LCDs)
- good FM reception.
- dual alarms.
- iPod menu navigation possible from remote control.
Cons: - non adjustable radio alarm volume!!
- below average sound from NXT speakers.
- no audio 'line out'.
- non dimmable display.
