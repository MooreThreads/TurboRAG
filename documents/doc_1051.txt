Clean Mixed Alcohol Fuels
“It’s not a solution unless it solves your problem.”
To build a strong business in the clean energy world, you need a solution that actually solves problems. And a tireless work ethic*, a big heart, a sparkly personality, a tough hide, and a big wallet. And a lot of luck, hard work, and tough decisions to succeed. We’ve got everything but the big wallet, but we’re working on that too.
But it’s not really a money problem. It’s you. And people you know. It’s me, it’s us. We need fossil-energy users to wake up and demand that this industry clean up its act. That means you. Your friends. Your acquaintances and theirs too.
*Tireless: This CEO has been telecommuting for 14 years, and working non-stop for the past 4 years on Bioroot Energy. Mark Radosevich, co-founder of Standard Alcohol and our chief scientist, has been working for 17 years to turn on ENVIROLENE® production.
We’ve spoken to a lot of people around the world about ENVIROLENE®. From politicians and hi-tech pundits, billionaires and garden-variety millionaire industrialists, to forestry people and regular business people, and our neighbors and friends, to a simple, kind and sweet man in Conner, Montana, who lives in a teepee, chops his own wood and carries his own water, and hitchhikes wherever he needs to go.
(I give “JP” rides into town if he’s out beside the road with his thumb out when I drive by. He has a survivor story for the ages. He’s disabled and can’t drive a car, but he loves hearing about Bioroot Energy and ENVIROLENE®.)
Few have taken time to understand the technology, and as a result none have decided to back it yet.
Folks at the top are the ones who really *inspire* me. These are the people who can still afford to dream.
Wealthy folks and venture capital types mostly think we’re dreamers who don’t have the right stuff (or backing from “others” like them already in place) to get it done. Playing it safe by letting others take the risk is their game, because it’s to their advantage. People with money can afford to sit and watch the world struggle under the weight of too much problem, not enough solution.
We’d rather try and fail than perpetuate the American status quo (currently something out a bad dream) with a know-nothing, do-nothing attitude and a fat bank account. Just because folks have money doesn’t mean they necessarily have a wealth of intelligence.
Folks in the middle really (really) hope the ENVIROLENE® opportunity proves as good as advertised. It is the middle class, after all, that has the most to gain from our clean fuel’s success. Playing life as it happens is all most middle class folks can do at this point. Although, some people do take time to leave an endorsement or drop a dollar or two in our community funded project account.
Folks at the bottom are in too much economic pain to see past the next paycheck, if they still have a job. These folks aren’t playing footsy with reality, they’re struggling to survive.
Folks in the middle and the bottom, we’re doing this for you and yours, and us and ours. If what we’re talking about seems too good to be true, don’t worry. This one’s all true. And your support is vital to our effort to spark the first two ENVIROLENE projects. Thank you.
