Conde Naste readers vote Sydney world’s best city – again!
The 25,116 votes from international travellers are in…and for a record breaking ninth year in a row, Sydney was announced the world’s number one city at the Conde Nast Traveler Reader’s Choice Awards held in New York.
How the voting works
Reader’s of the world’s premier travel magazine were asked to rate cities on a five-point scale: excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor for:
- atmosphere/ambience
- culture/sites
- friendliness
- lodging
- restaurants
- shopping
The final averaged scores represent the percentage of respondents who rated a city either excellent or very good.
How Sydney and the world scored
Sydney topped the globe with an average 86.1 percent of readers rating it excellent or very good across all categories. It trumped Florence (84.6), San Francisco (84.3) and Capetown (83.7) for the coveted international prize.
When you consider how the big three rated – New York (81), Paris (80.9), London (not even in the top 100) it’s an incredibly flattering and humbling reflection of how much international business travellers and tourists love Sydney. Melbourne was half way down the top 100 list with 78.6.
The Conde Naste reader’s choice survey started in 1988. Sydney has won the best city in the world award every year since 2001.
