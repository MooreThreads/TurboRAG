That’s great and really saves a lot of time. How about making the same for theme developers. 🙂
Genius! Thanks, I will give this a try.
Very nice Mark, thanks!
For a minute I thought it was a plugin to help you make plugins. What was I thinking of…
Hi!
I like to have my plugins as posts. There are no way to use you plugin for that, right?
A nice feature would be to be able to insert a shortcode in posts like [plugin name=”I make plugins”] and it will show the information of that plugin.
Let me know, would be great for me and probably others!
Good idea, that should be easy to do.
Does that mean you will add it to the next version? I don’t want to hack your plugin because then I need to do it every time I’ll update the plugin in the future.
If you add it and it works like expected, I’ll blog about your plugin on jenst.se and devdevote.
Good work so far anyway!
Looks amazing, would it be possible to add the
download-url shortcode on the “My Plugins” page?
Sure, I’ll add that for the next version!
LOL… Mark, love the title of this plugin. Very useful getting it for myself for future use 🙂
Great use of the shortcode API. Shortcodes are seriously one of my favorite parts of WordPress. 😀
Thank you soooo much for this video! I downloaded 1.0 a few nights ago and had no idea what to do with it… after watching the video, everything worked smoothly. Great plugin btw! Been looking for something like this for a while.
Wow, awesome plugin. I am salivating thinking about the same thing for the theme directory… Is there a similar API for the theme directory?
Excellent plugin! And very user friendly, we had it up and running in no time. It will definitely save lots of time and keep things in order.
‘Sweet’ does not express enough how freakin’ awesome this plugin is!
Agree with the others! AWESOME plugin – thank you
Is it possible to get plugin screenshots?
That’s pretty rad, man. Thanks!
Being in the process of writing my first plugin it is nice to see I csan take some shortcuts. Now I just need to learn to use the WP plugin repository 🙂
Very nice!
Great plugin Mark
Only suggestion I would have is to allow some control over where the plugin list template code is placed on that container page as I like to give a little context to my plugin work first.
To clarify – currently the cotaine page has:
Plugin list template
$content
I wouild like to have the option to display as
$content
Plugin list template
Thanks!
Agreed. I think I’ll include an optional [plugin_list] shortcode that you can manually place to override the default “append” behavior.
Mark: the cache is never really used because of missing parantheses. In addition to the change that I submitted earlier the line following that change needs to be edited, too, to have the descriptions show on the list page again. I have created a diff file that you can download here: – HTH
Thanx So Much
I want to install Plug in to my domain, please help me.
thanks
You are a wordpress God!
hye wt abt u?
Hi…I was wondering why the plugin page does not appear on my dashboard left panel? Have I installed it correctly? Thanks.
Great Plugin!!!
How about other languages?
In some plugins, in addition to “readme.txt”, there are “readme-{{WPLANG}}.txt” files where we add descriptions in other languages.
Can you add support for those files?
please
