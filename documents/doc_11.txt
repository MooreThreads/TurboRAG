The victim then picked Thomas Lee Carr out of a photo lineup as her assailant.
He is charged with attempted rape.
The woman said on Tuesday just before noon she was followed into the complex where she lives by a white male wearing a blue tank top and dark-colored pants.
She said he followed her up to the second floor, then forced his way into her room.
The woman said he then tried to take off her clothes while dropping his own pants. She said he tried to force her head down towards his crotch.
She said the man fled when a roommate entered the room.
After multiple outlets, including Chattanoogan.com, ran the photo that was taken off the complex's video camera, callers all said it was "Tom."
Police said, "They all stated they work with him at Amazon and they were adamant that was the individual."
One of the Amazon workers had the phone number for Tom and provided it to police.
Police were able to determine that it was Thomas Lee Carr and to pull up a Facebook photo of him.
The woman then picked him out of a six-person lineup.)
