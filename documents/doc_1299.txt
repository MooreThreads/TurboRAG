Mones S. Abu‐Asab holds a Ph.D. degree in phylogenetic systematics from Ohio University, Athens, OH, USA. He serves as a Senior Scientist at the National Eye Institute (NEI) of the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD, USA. Before joining NEI in October 2011, he had worked at the Laboratory of Pathology of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) since 1998. Additionally, Abu‐Asab has taught at Birzeit University (Palestinian West Bank, Birzeit, Palestine) and worked on phylogenetic analysis at the Smithsonian Institution (Washington, DC, USA), vaccine analysis at Water Reed Army Institute of Research (Silver Spring, MD, USA), database management at IBM, and ultrastructural pathology at the George Washington University (Washington, DC, USA). In his current position, Dr. Abu‐Asab works on clinical ultrastructural pathology as well as research. His record of publication is diverse and includes papers and book chapters on bioinformatics, systematics, tumor biology, virology, nerve pathology, traditional medical systems, and global warming. His 2001 publication on global warming prompted the advancement by a week of the famous Cherry Blossoms Festival in Washington, DC, USA. Most recently, he has been advocating the application of phylogenetic analysis to high‐throughput omics data in biomedical research. Abu‐Asab has been publishing on the topic, since 2006. His analyses have shown that parsimony phylogenetics is a multidimensional tool that can be utilized for disease modeling, profiling, subtyping, and biomarker discovery.
