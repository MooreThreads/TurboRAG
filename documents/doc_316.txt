This year our 7th and 8th graders can choose electives for the Integrated Arts. This year I'm offering Photography. We don't have a dark room, so we'll be using digital cameras and our cell phone cameras and there is still SO MUCH to learn just focusing on that!
Usually I start my art classes with a nametag project. It's a great way for me to get to know the kids and their names and chitchat with them.
It didn't seem appropriate to have the students in Photo draw their names and tell me about themselves in a traditional way, so I decided to have them create a photo collage using Google Slides and the fair use photos Google's search feature in Slides uses.
Our school uses the Google Suite and has for 18 months or so, so the students are somewhat familiar with it. This would be a good opportunity for them to brush up on their skills.
PART 1: See what Google Slides Can Do With Photos
Students were asked to create a Google Slide and use the Insert/Image/From the Web search feature to import an image of their choice. They then had to duplicate the image so that there were 9 total on the slide.
Then they need to learn about the adjustments you can make within Google slides. They needed to do the following:
- Enlarge a photo
- Shrink a photo
- Crop a photo
- Invert or flip a photo
- Change the transparency
- Adjust the brightness
- Adjust the contrast
- Recolor the image
