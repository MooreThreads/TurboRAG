thank you so much for sharing the links to all of these!
but most especially, thank you for mentioning what you did about supporting the artists and the problems with re-posting at Pinterest. it's so sad to see so many images on boards there. unfortunately Pinterest won't remove the images unless the artist themselves report each one. it's so much work that could be better spent drawing more fabulous images for us to play with.
everyone here is greatly appreciated for your hard work! thank you! :)
Thank you! :)
Thank you so much for highlighting the pin interest problem as an artist I love to share but find the swiping really hard to handle. Most people are lovely and leave comments and credit when appropriate which is all we hope for. Happy crafting everyone =) free digi team you are all stars!
