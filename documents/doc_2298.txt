2 thoughts on “Calving Hours”
Yes, no matter the number of calving season under your belt adjusting to two hour naps between checks is hard. We calve during the cold months also. We are bless to have indoor calving pens. So we towel off all newborns. A few need the cattle blower w/heat setting or use hair dryer. The best thing I started is purchasing an XXXL dog coat (big as you can get for largest dog). We put it on them first 24 hours. That way mom can lick away but the calf has extra warmth.
I love the idea of the dog coats and will have to go in search of a few. We have several blanks and are able to pull mom and baby indoors when necessary. And I too have used the hair blow dryer to help a new, cold and wet calf warm up and get his strength back. It does always amaze me how quickly the calves are up and running, playing and enjoying their time in the sun.
