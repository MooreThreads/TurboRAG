HOLT RECEIVES HIS SECOND
UNIVERSITY TEACHING AWARD
The second time around is even better than the first,
says Frank L. Holt,
two-time winner of a university-wide teaching excellence award.
Holt, professor of history, was awarded a 2005 Enron Teaching Excellence
Award. Yet, it isn’t the first honor he has received from
the university.
“When I won the University Teaching Excellence Award in 1990,
as well as the college’s Master Teacher Award in 1989, I think
it was because of my enthusiasm. Now, it’s because of my experience.
I have grown within the profession as a scholar and a mentor,”
Holt said.
In support of Holt, one student wrote, “Few professors possess,
much less openly display, such a love and a passion for their subject
matter as professor Frank L. Holt does.”
The award carries with it a trophy and a $5,000 check from an endowment
established by the Enron Corp. Nominees must be tenured/tenure track
faculty demonstrating excellence in teaching.
