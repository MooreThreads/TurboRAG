I’m a striver. No matter where I am in life, or what I have, there’s always something just beyond my reach that I want. So whenever I get into my “want” mode, I have to remind myself that just a few years ago, I dreamed about my current reality.
At some point, the notion of having my own phone line (when home phones were a thing, lol), having my own car, having my own place, getting a dog, taking a vacation and launching a PR firm, were all things that I yearned for. And I’ve worked very hard to get all of that and then some but I’ve also developed a bad habit of hastily tossing my accomplishments aside while in pursuit of the next goal.
So one of the things that I’m working on is living more graciously and embracing every moment (good or bad) with gratitude and appreciation.
I don’t think nostalgia would evoke such strong emotions if we actually realized how good we have it right now.
So instead of focusing on the best that is yet to come, I’m soaking in the best that is right now. Because I know that I won’t be in this spot for long, so I better start enjoying it while I still can.
