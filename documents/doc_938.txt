Everybody faces difficult times. For some people, getting help seems impossible. That’s why we have created a program that truly addresses your needs, provides professional care, and inspires you to reach your goals.
Many programs can provide treatment for your condition, but they may not acknowledge or address your deeper spiritual needs. RENEWAL: Christian Treatment and Recovery is a unique program that incorporates your spirituality into your treatment. Our faith-based approach provides an atmosphere of compassion and support that encourages openness, restoration, and healing.
Pastoral counseling, chapel services, and daily devotional readings are just some of the services that set RENEWAL apart from other programs. We invite you to explore our website to learn more about Brookhaven Hospital’s RENEWAL program, and discover how our patients and their families find their way to happier, healthier lives.
