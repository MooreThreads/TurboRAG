Preschool are four.
We started this experiment by gathering gummy bears, 4 cups, water, vinegar, salt and baking soda. Rosie cataloged her supplies in her journal. She narrated to us what she wanted us to write, and we wrote it word for word.
She had so much fun mixing up concoctions!
Then she guessed what would happen and I wrote it down for her. She put the gummies in overnight and we waited to see what would happen!
She documented the results in her journal!
The next morning, we woke up and checked on our gummies and reported our findings!
You can print out your own science journals to document your little one’s first observations! Page 1 Page 2
We use these journals in our wonderful curriculum “A Year of Playing Skillfully“… you can find it in our store!
Happy Discovering!
Most of children love gummy bear. It will be interesting to do the experiment with the gummy bears.
I love your journal!! I printed these for my preschool classroom because I love the idea that you left them so open ended. Children are free to express their ideas in their own way and take ownership of their Science Journals!! Its a very grown up looking design too so they will feel like real scientists doing it!! I can’t wait to use them!!
