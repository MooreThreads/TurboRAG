In the heat of Summer, many of you are using your outdoor living spaces by the pool on a regular basis. We find that now is the time we like to start thinking about a refresh of those spaces for Fall.
Things like a new rug, new cushions and even new furniture can get you ready for Fall entertaining and grilling. Here in Texas we use our outdoor spaces almost year round, so don’t forget a fire pit to roast marshmallows, a full outdoor kitchen and all of the furniture and accessories you need to make it feel more like a room.
Here are some of our favorite outdoor living spaces we have designed for our clients::
