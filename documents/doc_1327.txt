from "Atalanta in Calydon" by A. C. Swinburne
I know we will have another cold spell and no doubt more snow before spring settles in for good, but what a sweet foretaste yesterday was.
Spent about an hour cleaning up the lilac grove, which was roughly pruned by our heavy snows this winter. Now I must cut up the branches I removed from the old lilacs. I'm saving that for next weekend.
Spent a half hour relocating the clods of earth scraped up by Gene's plow as he cleared the driveway through the winter. Rain and time will settle them back in.
Then spent about two hours (the reward!) bagging up old peony leaves (should have done this last fall, but . . . oh, well!) and cutting back the broomstraw that was miscanthus and aster and sedum and raking out old leaves from the garden. Labeled all the plants I could locate with the same kind of marker (zinc tags) so that I can see at a glance where everything is. All in preparation for the great migration that will occur as I dig the new bed and rethink where things belong.
Later in the afternoon B and I drove to Hudson Falls to our favorite nursery so we could drink in the smell of sun and earth in the greenhouses where the owner is starting snapdragons and marigolds and pansies. Seeing all of these little plants sending up their first leaves is, as B says, "Hope in tangible form."
Note to self: Pine tree we would love to see growing at Pleasant Hill (after seeing a mature specimen growing at the nursery): Pinus parviflora "Tempelhof"
Hope in tangible form. I really like that. :) Sounds like a delicious weekend; can't wait to see what Pleasant Hill's gardens hold this year!
