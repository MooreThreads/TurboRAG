Yes, but DL doesn't accept unless the "Sua" or "Lei" starts with a capital. Not necessarily correct, but that's DL's normal practice.

"I never feel well" sounds very odd unless I am talking about my health. Better "I never feel comfortable"

Couldn't this also mean: I never HEAR well in his presence? (Like he speaks too softly?) - it counted me incorrect. If that would be a different sentence, please let me know.

Sentire = feel (tactile), hear, sense
- Sento freddo (I am/feel cold)
- Senti quel rumore? (Do you hear that sound?)
Sentirsi (reflexive) goes with abstract concepts
- Mi sento molto solo (I feel very lonely)
- Come ti senti oggi? (How do you feel today?)

Feel well disturbs me well generally refers to health issues when you refer to psycholpgical issues would'nt you say feel good in the US?
Why not "in la sua presenza". I can't work out the rule about this - I know you don't use the definite article for close relations but I can't work out out why you drop it in cases like this
