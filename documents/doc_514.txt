6' 4-Wire 30, Dryer Cord (PT600L Other) - In addition to grounding the frame of the range or clothes dryer, the grounded circuit conductor of those present branch circuits is likewise authorized to be used to ground any junction packing containers within the circuit presenting the appliance, and a three-cord pigtail and variety receptacle are authorised to be used. The exception to 250.A hundred and forty applies only to current branch circuits presenting the appliances specified in 250.140. The grounded conductor (impartial) of newly set up branch circuits presenting ranges and garments dryers isn't permitted for use for grounding the non–present day-wearing steel components of the home equipment. Department circuits mounted for new equipment installations are required to provide an gadget grounding conductor sized in accordance with 250.122 for grounding the non–current-wearing metallic elements.
I purchased a brand new 3 pronged cable from home depot. Am i able to put that cable into this dryer and easy join it to the wall? Is that safe? Will it paintings? In that case, what do i do approximately the spot for the grounding twine? I would love to look a video/image of this being accomplished. Frames of electrical tiers, wall-established ovens, counter-hooked up cooking units, clothes dryers, and outlet or junction packing containers that are a part of the circuit for those appliances shall be connected to the system grounding conductor inside the manner precise by way of 250.134 or 250.138.
I recognize that that is an old post - however i've been working a comparable trouble using my 3 pin older 10-30r dryer outlet for my electric 240volt vehicle (chevy volt) charger. The simplest difference between the brand new standard (1996 to offer) receptacle which is a 14-30r - four twine 30amp/240 volt and the 10-30r - 3 cord 30amp/240 volt receptacle is the lacking ground pin. That doesn't suggest there may be no floor twine hidden in the junction box containing the receptacle - it is there 99.9 of the time until someone reduce it off the cable. The electric cable whether romex or old-fashioned steel included bx has a ground cord (the metal guard if bx or a naked floor wire if romex) - just pass it from wherever it is related (usually to the metallic junction container mounting screw) and make bigger it to the brand new replacement 14-30r receptacle which you ought to have bought from anywhere you purchased the dryer (or you could get it at lowes or home depot) - we're talking about $11 bucks, there about - this can come up with your 4 wire/4 pin connection (hot - black, warm - crimson, neutral - white and naked copper- floor) proper at your outlet - no want to run a further cord from within the field to the dryer. Placed lower back the 4 prong twine that got here with the dryer - make certain no bond from white to floor and be performed with it - value is minimum and a far neater and safer manner to do it. What am i lacking? Also - your receptacle is either 240 or one hundred twenty can't have both within the equal field. Perhaps i did no longer recognize what you intended by way of that statement.
