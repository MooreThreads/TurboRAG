Vice President Mike Pence Weighs In On North Korea Situation
WASHINGTON--Columbus, Indiana native and Vice President Mike Pence is backing President Trump in the conflict with North Korea.
North Korea claims to have successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, topped with a "super-large heavy warhead," which is capable of strking the U.S. mainland.
The country's state media made the announcement Wednesday, hours after leader Kim Jong Un ordered the 3 a.m. launch of the Hwasong-15 missile, which reached the highest altitude ever recorded by a North Korean missile.

That echoed President Trump's comments on North Korea.
The launch was the first since September, and came despite repeated warnings from President Donald Trump who told reporters at the White House after the launch that the US "will handle" the situation.
