Here at Amara, we have been brainstorming on how we can be of service as we launch this phase of our healing center.
Our focus this spring has been integrating movement classes into our clinic space, and we want to invite everyone to our amazing new offerings! We have classes in Qi Gong, Taoist yoga and Meditation. We have decided to have a Grand Opening introducing our movement instructors with activities including music, dinner catered by Mandala, discounted massages and discounted movement classes!
So join us on March 26th for our grand opening- what is sure to be a memorable day for all!!
