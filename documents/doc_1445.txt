My passion for photography began organically, by taking photos for family, friends, and fellow members of my congregation. As my love for visual storytelling grew, I sought out professional photographers who took me under their wing, and helped me to develop a signature style.
My signature style is designed to deliver a clean and engaging method of visual storytelling which captures the beauty of a forgotten moment, and to commemorate milestones and magical moments. Also to deliver a photo or video that can shared and relived for generations to come.
This is what inspires me!
I have had the privilege of providing my photography and videography for clients around the nation, and now with our new studio location in Luray, VA I can provide my services full-time in my hometown.
