The Kansas City Royals and the Minnesota Twins face off on Thursday in game one of their MLB series of the top two teams in American League Central.
The Kansas City Royals were swept in Houston to start the week but are still in first place in the AL Central. The Royals are 22-13 at home, 5-5 in their last 10 games, and they are 13 games over .500. As a team the Royals are hitting .271 with Mike Moustakas hitting .308, Lorenzo Cain hitting .299, and Eric Hosmer hitting .290. The Royals pitching staff has an ERA of 3.56 with the starters at 4.46 and the bullpen at 2.06. For Thursday’s game the Royals start Chris Young who has allowed 49 hits and 21 earned runs while striking out 45 over 69.2 innings for a 7-3 record and a 2.71 ERA.

The Minnesota Twins have continued to surprise many as they are very much in contention and in second place in the AL Central. The Twins are 4-6 in their last 10 games, 16-22 on the road, and they are 4.5 games behind the Royals in the standings. As a team the Twins are hitting .251 with Torii Hunter hitting .271, Brian Dozier hitting .268, and Joe Mauer hitting .262. The Twins pitching staff has an ERA of 3.91 with the starters at 3.91 and the bullpen at 3.92. For Thursday’s game the Twins start Kyle Gibson who has allowed 88 hits and 34 earned runs while striking out 58 over 92.2 innings for a 5-6 record and a 3.30 ERA.
Kansas City is 9-1 as a favorite, 4-1 against the AL Central, and 7-3 in Young’s last 10 starts. Minnesota is 4-1 following a loss, 2-6 in their last eight road games, and 1-4 in Gibson’s last five starts. Minnesota is 2-6 in their last eight games in Kansas City.
It’s tough to turn it off and turn it back on and I see the Royals starting slow here and the Twins taking this one.
