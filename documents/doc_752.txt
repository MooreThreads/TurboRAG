Definitely not an (Almost) Wordless Wednesday
#22 – Your Shoes
Yes, I am wearing hiking boots with sweatpants — in public. This is not a fancy town. I’m not helping to raise the fashion bar but then I’m not slipping and sliding in the parking lot, either.
#23 – Something Old
This plate was a wedding gift from a dear old friend (her own mother lived to 102). The plate was hand-painted in Japan. There’s so much more to tell but it really deserves a post of its own someday.
#24 – Guilty Pleasure
Really? Does it have to be about guilt? I suppose I could post a picture of a chocolate bar, but I’m trying to see a small piece of dark chocolate as a healthy part of the day – something that keeps me from thinking there is no pleasure in a life-change eating plan.
Or perhaps I should have photographed a LaVyrle Spencer romance novel, but since she is now retired there are no longer new books of hers being published. I feel that loss most when I go to the library without my wish-list of books that I’d like to read.
So I guess I am left with 4bucks. I don’t like giving money to them. I can make a perfectly good cup of coffee at home – and I usually do – but once in a while, it is a treat to stop in and purchase a latte. I’d probably be a devoted sucker if they offered pumpkin lattes year-round.
#25 – Something you made
Let’s see… I’ve made my bed… but you’ve already seen a picture of that…
I am going to resist the rather sick urge to show you the lovely spots I’ve made, compliments of a formerly dormant varicella virus. Apparently I have Shingles – although a brain tumor might have explained how I managed leaving out a title for that post. No, I didn’t leave the diagnosing to the interwebs; I actually took myself to the urgent care clinic yesterday. The pain was turning me into a Pain, so my husband muttered about a grizzly bear with a toothache and sent me out the door.
By the time I got home again, I wasn’t about to make anything just so I could photograph it. The only idea remaining was a mess — after all, I do seem to make a lot of them.. Perhaps I should photograph a mess? There are quite a few to choose from but they aren’t very nice to look at…
It was at this point that I looked around the room and noticed that no one had put away the puzzle I recently completed. Voilà!
Okay, so it’s not a rum cake or a quilt, but it was challenging and I did put it together… plus it looks nicer than the mess I could have shown you.
I share your LaVyrle Spencer guilty pleasure. I have to purge my bookshelves periodically, or I would run out of room, but I always keep her books.
Wait, what’s wrong with hiking boots and sweat pants?! Fashion seems less important when there’s the chance of breaking a leg.
I contribute almost $4 to Panera for a latte every week day. And I don’t feel guilty. 🙂
My mom and my best friend have both had shingles, and I know how much pain they were in. I hope it will go away soon, and not come back.
shingles! OUCH! hope you heal up quickly. That is NO fun! I’ve never had it (knock on wood), but I saw a guy who did and it just looked incredibily painful!
I’ve heard that shingles are awful, I hope they clear up fast. Lovely plate and the puzzle is a good kind of mess.
Lovely shots, Karen but UGH for those shingles. Their initial appearance is strange and I so understand your fearful diagnosis. I had them when I first suspected I was pregnant with my second son. I had a huge lump in my lymph node and I jumped to the conclusion that I had cancer and was taking this baby with me. Well, it was just shingles and I was relieved.. baby was healthy.. and you’ll get through them too. I hope they clear up soon with as little pain as possible. Gentle hugs to you.
I came over from Cassi’s blog at “Bad at Being Mom.” I love your photos in your “photo a day” challenge (which would be too much of a challenge for me. I sincerely hope and pray the shingles go away as soon as possible.
I’m so sorry about the shingles! I’ve never had them, but word on the street is they are very painful. But better than a brain tumor, no?
shingles!! gah, you poor thing! glad you went to the dr though – i know someone who tried to “tough out” her shingles and now has PERMANENT SCARS from it. so, doctor intervention = a good thing 🙂
OH no – I gather that shingles can be very painful! Get well soon.
