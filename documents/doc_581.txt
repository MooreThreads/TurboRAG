Report of the Secretary
It has been my pleasure to serve as the secretary for the ELCIC since the last convention. This is a role that I take on as a volunteer living in Victoria. There are some complexities of being distant from the office of the Church, but email works, as does the telephone.
My major reporting responsibilities are covered in other reports, Nominations Committee, (for which I am the facilitator), Constitution Committee (for which I was the chair) and as an officer and member of NCC. The general work of the secretary is in assistance with preparing material for council meetings, overseeing minutes, answering many emails and requests for information and working with the staff in the National Office.
Change is not an easy thing for many of us to accept, but nevertheless change occurs. The ELCIC is in a time of change. The role of the national expression of this church, the role of the synodcal expressions of this church and the role of the congregations of this church are evolving to express the realities of the church in the world in 2005. Some of this is not easy, as an example; there are not the resources that we previously had to develop new programs and supports. That means we have to change the way we do things.
There is also the increasingly affirming and developing relationships with the Anglican Church of Canada. Some things that we used to do on our own, we now do jointly; and that causes us to change some of our ways.
But in spite of the change, there is also a constant, the Christ who came down to earth to let us live by Grace and experience Peace and openness. May we have the courage to experience change while continuing to focus on the essence of what it means to be this Lutheran church in Canada.
