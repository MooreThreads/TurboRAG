Good morning! Well, I’m still trying to play catch-up with some projects I need to get done! I think I need to get off my butt during the day and head into the studio . . . classes to prepare for, blog hops to get ready for, and THEN I found out tonight that I have just a few weeks to get my projects ready for my class at Stampfest Orlando. I need to make my to-do list and put it somewhere I can find it.
I’m still working on samples for my alcohol inks class and one thing I wanted to show my class is how different papers effect the outcome of the alcohol inks. One of my favorite techniques with alcohol inks is faux bleach. The results you get are so different than those with actual dyes.
This is the sample tag I worked on last night trying to find the right mix of stamps and inks.
Its probably not what I’m going to end up with, but it’s a starting point. The wildflower silhouette was embossed first and then the alcohol inks were applied over the top. The grid background is stamped with a combination of more blending solution than ink to get a light detail. After the grid was stamped, the embossing was ironed off to show the white base tag. The image on the back of the fragment was done the same way. For more information on these steps, you can find my tutorial here and one with color wash here. I’ll be doing a video for these soon for you!
