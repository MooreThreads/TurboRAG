Since yesterday's post was about black, today's is dedicated to bright colors, after all it is summer. Neon colors are always a fun summer festival look. Hyper Crush's retro 80s disco hip-hop music style is complimented by their fashion sense.
Look at all the bright colors that Holly is wearing in this photo from a recent San Francisco show.
Preston rocks a neon yellow striped shirt, bright purple pants, and a funky 80s nostalgic colorful watch.
The following pictures are from last Saturday's show at the Air-conditioned Lounge in Venice.
