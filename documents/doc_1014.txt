MINIMALIST WADING JACKET
Need a windproof, waterproof, breathable, packable rainjacket without unnecessary frills? Look no further than Patagonia’s Minimalist, which weighs in at just 10.7 ounces. It’s made from Patagonia’s 100 per cent recycled nylon ripstop fabric, with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish. It has a fully adjustable hood and cuffs, a waist bungee, two upper fly-box pockets, fleece-lined hand-warmer pockets and corrosion-proof plastic zippers.

GUIDE WADER BELT ZS
Talk about an ideal wading belt—not only does it prevent your waders from filling with water in case of a spill, it also securely holds your landing net. Umpqua’s reverse-cinching belt tightens snugly, and it’s five inches wide at the back to provide back support for a long day of wading. Made from granite-coloured 420-denier nylon, the Guide Wader Belt ZS also features two shielded nipper or accessory ports.
