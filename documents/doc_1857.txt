On to the clothes. We went out a few times, but I forgot to take pictures of a couple of the outfits. They weren't anything too great anyway.
I got to hang out with a dear friend of mine I haven't seen in ages. (she works more than me....) We went Christmas shopping and had a chance to catch up.
sweater, boots- Target. jeans- Forever 21. boot socks- Wet Seal. scarf- Walmart
Story and I went to Target. Who am I kidding, Story and I go to Target
every day lots of times a week. Can't beat the discount. But after being sick I felt like stepping up my game. I even used my new camera. It still takes blurry pictures, but I'm working on it.
shirt- Old Navy. trouser jeans- Banana Republic. belt- Forever 21. bracelet- World Market
I had curled my hair pretty intense and then didn't like it. So I brushed it out and just went with a pony tail.
shoes- Merona at Target.
I really like these shoes. They are a half size too big. I have to stuff them with a lot of toilet paper. It kind of works, but by the time I take them off my feet really hurt.
Can't wait to show you all of the outfits for next week!!!! We have matching Christmas outfits that are amazing! And the in- laws are coming to visit. My Mother in law is a fashion genius. Going to have to step up my game while she's in town. Can't wait :) :)
Merry Christmas!
