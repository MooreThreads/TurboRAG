Cameron Munster seals preliminary final with clutch field goal in game for the ages
''What a game of rugby league to kick off the finals.''
Have you got your breath back yet? We certainly haven't.
Melbourne and South Sydney have kicked off the 2018 NRL finals in emphatic style with what we are boldly labelling the game of the season in a try-scoring fiesta that kept you on your toes for the full 80 minutes.

When one team bashed someone in a tackle, the other hit back twice as hard.
When one team took control, the other pulled out a magical play.
And when one team had the lead, the other reeled it back.
It was insane. It was first class entertainment. It was what we all were expecting.
Of course it had to end with a field goal. The rugby league gods wouldn't allow it to happen any other way.
Storm five-eighth Cameron Munster put the icing on the cake with a last-gasp one-pointer that sailed right down the centre of the uprights at AAMI Park, lifting the passionate crowd off their feet.
The build-up play was even better, back-tracking to the old days of the Melbourne 'Big Three' with a signature inside, outside play that saw Billy Slater split the defence through a combination move with Munster and Smith.
South Sydney looked to have caused a huge upset after Cameron Murray breezed his way through the defence in the 71st minute to give the away side a 28-22 lead.
If it was the play that sealed the game, there could have been a major blow-up as the Bunnies were given a golden scoring opportunity through a dodgy forward pass ruling on Josh Addo-Carr.
But the officiating is history and the Rabbitohs leave Melbourne without winning a game in their entire history at AAMI Park.
They now await the winner of Brisbane and St George Illawarra on Sunday for a home final at ANZ Stadium next week.
