Do you have an emergency at your property where your water will not turn off?
In instances where emergencies arise, follow the below steps to isolate your water and call a plumber immediately if you cannot isolate the water to the property and you have an emergency
Contain & Isolate the Water
If possible, try and contain the water leak into a bucket or by diverting it into a drain if possible. If the leak is urgent and damaging property, the first step should be to isolate the water immediately
Turn Main Water Off (House)
If you are in a house, turn your main water off clockwise till the water stops. Turn an external tap outside to drain the water out of the house line and call a plumber immediately if your taps continue to drip.
Turn Main Isolation Valve Off (Unit)
If you are in a unit, turn the main isolation valve off clockwise till the water stops. The location in a unit varies where they could be installed. It is extremely important to become familiar with where the valves are located prior to an emergency
This is what the valve should look like:
Only the top half of the valve will be protruding out of the wall.
Turn it clockwise till the water stops
Are your drains overflowing?
This is a warning sign that your drains are blocked
Emergency Drain Blockage Sydney
The team at Sydney’s Plumbing Specialists provide same day service for blocked drain services throughout Sydney. An overflowing drain external to the property is an indication that the main sewer line is blocked. If a line is overflowing internally, this may mean the blockage is generalised and maybe only blocked on a certain fixture
CCTV Camera Inspection
A plumber will be needed to attend and with the use of a high pressure jet blaster, clear the blockage and conduct a CCTV camera inspection on the sewer or stormwater line to determine what caused the blockage in the first instance. Without conducting a CCTV camera inspection, the issue will most likely re occur.
How does flooding occur?
The main causes of flooding within properties are generally from burst pipes/hoses or flooding which have ruptured and caused a significant amount of water damage throughout the property. This is an extremely stressful situation and could mean a large insurance claim.
What should you do?
We recommend you complete the following. The main priority is to try and stop the leak or flood from continuing. Whether this means turning off the mains immediately till help arrives, or whether it means using the below steps to help prevent any further damage.
Turn off electrical hazards
If there is a risk of water leaking or dripping onto any electrical power points or outlets, turn off the circuit breakers labelled protected power to ensure no water leaks onto any fixtures and causes a safety hazard
Protect areas of your property
Where possible, place buckets or towels down to protect certain areas of the property. We highly recommend, anything valuable be moved to safe location away from floor level if there is an immediate risk of these objects becoming damaged
Contain the leaks
Try and contain the leak or place something over it to stop it from spreading
Ensure that help is on the way!
A qualified technician will be needed to help prevent any further damage. This is critical so no further problems or damage occurs
