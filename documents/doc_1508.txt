" I photoshopped helmets and masks onto copper miners. The ad was for the world's largest mining company. The workers had been natives living in the jungle a year earlier. No protective gear was worn in the source photo. One of them was clearly a child (until the mask went on)."

Love this one...
‘As a freelancer, I often turn down work because I'm going out of town, have a social engagement, or am just to lazy to wake up before noon. I never tell them this, I just say I'm booked. Also, I never take work right away, I say "let me see if I can move some stuff around, I'll call you right back" then I watch hulu/check email/masturbate for 30 minutes, then call back and take the job, while implying they owe me a favor for making room in my busy, busy schedule. Since I started doing this, my business has tripled.’

"Working at pharma, I helped create testimonials, misleading content and relationships for high budget orgs (cancer, aids, __ awareness, __ prevention, etc). Content that is specifically aimed at Drs to get them to recommend our clients brand to desperate patience or to get our clients names into studies they have no place in. Recently my wife got a serious disease and I don't believe anything the Drs tell us."

Reading all of this depresses me to no end. Why did I get into this business again ... ?

have to agree with this:
"I think 'designing in the browser' is like designing a chair by going to a workshop and nailing wood together until you have something you can sit in. The results are dull and it's advocates seem to be failed designers who use coding to hide their lack of imagination."
