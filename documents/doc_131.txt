Super comfortable
- Familiarity: I've used it several times
I love this harness.
I've used it mostly for gym climbing so far, but it's been really awesome. I'd recommend it to just about anyone! Very lightweight, thin and not at all bulky, I love the non-adjustable leg loops. This may be my perfect harness.
I also work in a gym, so I'm often belaying for long periods of time, and I've ended up wearing this harness for 6+ hours just because it was so comfortable that I didn't feel like taking it off!
Sizing is an issue
- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringer
I have been using the R280 from 2008 forever and love love love it. Not sure when the sizing changed but there are 2 major problems that would easily be fixed. 1. New models do not have a waist strap that is long enough. I have narrow hips, this would be so much worse if they were normal or large. I have the small and I can barely squeeze my hips through the harness (often I just unbuckle it). I cinch it down as tight as it goes, so a medium would be too big in the waist although it would be easier getting over my hips. The issue here is having to unbuckle the strap, not a great thing as when rebuckling if a mistake is made it could be fatal. Please, please make this strap longer! Yes it might flap around but that is insignificant to fitting well. The R280 has 4 " longer. 2. The leg straps are not long enough. I am somewhat long waisted, so perhaps this does not affect alot of women. The leg loops ride up to my crotch which is incredibly uncomfortable after about 10 minutes belaying. A 2 week trip climbing daily left me with bruises around my crotch. Another 2-3" of extension on the leg loops would allow this to fit almost any body type. Cross posting in hopes of getting the engineers' attention, I do not want to switch to another harness--these are the absolute best when they fit right :)
Best Harness

I climb in this harness for 24 hours straight and I never noticed it once!
Step Up Your Harness Game
- Familiarity: I've used it once or twice and have initial impressions
Fit: Arcteryx fits small. I wear a small in Black diamond harnesses, and originally tried a small in another Arcteryx harness, and was bummed to find that it fit a bit tight around the thighs and almost too small around the waste. I probably could have made it work, but my thighs were a bit too muscular for comfort in the small. Got a medium and fits much better, although may be a bit larger around the waste. Chronic problem. For comparison, I wear a size 8 in arcteryx pants, but a 6 in most other brands.
Performance/Use: This harness is awesome â€“ the material and fit make it super nice to climb in, the gear loops are more heavy duty than my previous BD harness. I only use it for sport/lead climbing, but have been pleased with performance.
Lightweight yet super burly
- Familiarity: I've put it through the wringer
I've used a previous generation of this Arc'teryx harness for 5+ years and it's held up wonderfully - I've completely put it through the wringer and it's still in fantastic condition with no obvious wear and tear. I love that it's super light and doesn't feel like you're wearing a harness at all, yet it's comfy on long hanging belays. Great for hot days and long approaches, and doesn't start hurting if you're working a move and falling over and over.
I use this for cragging, alpine climbing and canyoneering. I can fit two thin layers under the leg loops (wool long undies and hiking pants) if needed. I have a different harness for ice climbing and mountaineering when I need thicker layers and/or the ability to put my harness on while wearing crampons. I love that it stuffs so small and takes up almost no space in my pack.
I'm expecting to get a lot more mileage out of this harness, and when it's finally time to move on, I will definitely come back and buy another one.
The most comfortable harness ever
- Familiarity: I've used it several times
I also love how low profile this harness is. It compacts down super small, which is great for getting to remote crags and bike to climb endeavors.
Yay! photo shoot!
Am I even wearing a harness?
- Familiarity: I've used it several times
So light and comfortable! that is what makes or breaks a harness! After having an Arcteryx harness I'm not sure I can go back to my other harness! Arcteryx's webbing design is truly the way to go. In the gym or on the big wall you cannot go wrong with the FL 355! Most people are skeptical about the non adjustable leg loops but they are not as bad an you would think. I actually preffer it because the buckles don't get in the way or get caught on anything. I love the minimalist weight of the harness Also the protected gear loops are nice too so you don't have to worry about the loop wearing as quickly as a fabric loop does.
