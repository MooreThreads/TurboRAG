Ginger Fried Beef – The Calgary Equal to Bon Bons
THUNDER BAY – If you like tasty Chinese food, here is a recipe that is sure to please. If you are in Calgary, Ginger Beef is a Chinese staple as much as Bon Bons are here in Thunder Bay. This is a dish famous first in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and then all Alberta, and now in your home!
In Calgary, the debate rages on over where the best Ginger Fried Beef cann be found. I have two favourites. One is Pang Pangs deep in the south of the city, the other is from Golden Chopsticks on the southwest of the city. However for Calgarians who take their Ginger Beef seriously, my choices would likely start an argument.
Ginger beef is the ultimate comfort food. This famous dish, consisting of marinated beef deep-fried in batter and coated with a sweet hot sauce is a staple of Alberta Chinese restaurants. In winter it helps warm you up, on hot summer nights it is a spicy dish that will cool you down.
You can make your Ginger Beef as hot and spicy, or as sweet as you like. All it takes is a little practice.

Directions:
Cut beef into long strips, cutting along the grain. (The meat is easier to cut if it is partially frozen). As you get more experienced, you can decide if you like really crispy Ginger Beef, in which case you make thinner strips. If you like a chewier Ginger Beef you make the strips thicker.
To make ginger juice for marinade, peel and grate ginger. Squeeze out juice. Mix four marinade ingredients. Add to beef and marinate for at least 30 minutes.
Begin preparing vegetables. Cut carrots, celery, and peppers into thin strips. Mince garlic. For ginger, use the leftover minced ginger from the preparation of ginger juice.
Mix the sauce ingredients. Set aside.
Beat the egg white and add water. Add flour and cornstarch. Mix the batter thoroughly. Pour the batter into the marinated meat.
Heat wok. When heated, add. To make your Ginger Beef a little spicier, add more chili peppers.
