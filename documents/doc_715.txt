Stakeholder Mapping Tool
Use this tool to help you to identify your key stakeholders (those individuals, groups or organisations) that will need to be kept informed of the situation and with whom, 2-way communication will be key. Think about what is important to them and how they could be impacted by the different scenarios or actions and how you can best prepare for and maintain minimal disruption. Eg. If your production line were to slow down or stop, or if your staff becomes reduced or works remotely – how would this impact your customers? Prioritise them by giving them an impact score of high / medium or low.Download
