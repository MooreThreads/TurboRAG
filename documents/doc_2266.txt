US SENATORS HUSBAND CAUGHT IN HOTEL WITH ESCORT
June 16, 2008
Alycia Martin, 20, of Westland was arrested in April and charged with prostitution. According to Troy police, Martin was paid $150 to perform oral sex on Thomas Athans, husband of U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). Athans told police that he paid Martin for sex at the Residence Inn on Livernois. The hotel was under police surveillance when a man went into a room and emerged 15 minutes later. Athans was stopped on I-75 and admitted to having paid a prostitute for sex, police said.
Athans agreed to testify against the alleged prostitute, and he was charged only with driving with a suspended license, a charge that was quickly cleared up. Athans was not charged with soliciting.
Martin’s attorney, Frank Cusumano of Macomb, alleges the search of her hotel room violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and is trying to get the case thrown out of court.
Martin’s next court date is 1:30 p.m. June 3. She remains out on a $100 bond.
ENFORCEMENT APPROACHES
Troy police admit their handling of a prostitution case involving the husband of a U.S. senator who wasn’t charged has drawn questions.
…………………”There are literally thousands and thousands of dollars changing hands, maybe millions, in the escort industry,” Troy Police Lt. Gerry Scherlinck said. “We have an officer on it, but we aren’t naive enough to think it isn’t still going on.”
Scherlinck said both buyers and sellers of sex feel safe in suburbs like Troy. The escorts like the security of knowing violent offenders don’t often strike in the suburbs and clients like the relative obscurity of hooking up at a suburban hotel, where police aren’t thought to have much of a presence.
In the most recent case, police were monitoring the escort Web site eros.com when an ad for services in Troy was spotted. Police made several calls to the escorts, who eventually divulged their location thinking they were talking to customers. Officers were staking out the Northfield Hilton when customers arrived.
A Port Huron man, 37, told police he paid $300 for sex. Later, a Farmington Hills man, 58, said he also paid $300 for a sex act after leaving a different room. Both men signed statements as to what happened and they were released.
Two women, both from Sunny Isles, Fla., were arrested and charged with prostitution. One was 23 years old and the other 37. The maximum penalty is 93 days in jail and/or a $500 fine. The case against both women is still pending…………………..READ FULL STORY
