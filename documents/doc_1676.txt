Star Trek Foods for Every Occasion
Chris-Rachael Oseland, the Kitchen Overlord, specializes in preparing geeky foods, from Wonder Woman potatoes to Alien facehugger eggs. She often does thematic weeks focused on particular franchises, such as the recent Dune Week.
Most recently, she's held a Star Trek week with custom recipes inspired by the greatest of all science fiction franchises. Pictured above is her Klingon blood orange pull-apart bread. It's made with blood oranges, not Klingon blood--not that I doubt Chris-Rachael's prowess with a bat'leth.
Here's her meatloaf made to resemble (but not taste like) a horta.
Mama Horta's eggs look just like those in the classic episode "Devil in the Dark," but are actually silver Sixlets, a type of hard candy. That's okay, because baby hortas are sweet.
The Ferengi are among the most fascinating species in the Star Trek universe. They were nicely developed by writers in Deep Space Nine. The Ferengi are flawed in some ways, but I think that they are the most realistic society described in Star Trek. It's not a coincidence that a Ferengi has been my online avatar for years.
So I'm especially delighted by Chris-Rachael's Ferengi ears made with canned cinnamon bun dough. Chris-Rachael calls making them "disgustingly easy." Be sure to add the orange frosting as ear wax, which is where the intense flavor comes from.
