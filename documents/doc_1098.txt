LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--On Tuesday, January 4, 2011, plaintiff attorneys Panish Shea & Boyle and Filippo Marchino of the X-Law Group filed a nationwide class-action lawsuit against the makers of the Power Balance bracelet. The suit alleges unfair business practices and false advertising. The suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Southern Division, and has been assigned to Judge Cormac J. Carney.
The suit alleges that Power Balance advertised that “Mylar holograms” at the center of their bracelets were “embedded with frequencies that react positively with a body’s natural energy field.” Power Balance touted that their bracelets would produce “faster synaptic response (brain function), enhanced muscle response (in both fast and slow twitch tissues), increased stamina (better oxygen uptake and recovery), more flexibility (faster recovery) and very improved gravitational balance.”
But upon investigation by Australian authorities, Power Balance ultimately admitted in writing that they had no credible scientific evidence that their bracelets worked, and that it had in fact engaged in misleading conduct in breach of Australian law.
An investigation by the two southern California law firms that filed the suit revealed that Power Balance was engaged in the same misleading trade practices in the United States. The law firms filed the suit hours before the Associated Press published a nationwide story about Power Balance’s admission of having no evidence that their product worked.
It is estimated that in excess of 3 million people were deceived, including numerous high-profile athletes. Information for consumers who purchased Power Balance products will be available on.
