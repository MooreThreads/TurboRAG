Long and fairly open. Two creeks run through it, creating 9 holes with water hazards for pros. Long tee to practice basket is over a pond. Bring your water discs! Crowded on nice days.

My home course and favorite. Well maintained. Course is flat and creek that winds through this course has takin many a disc from me! Some nice scenery on the bike path too. Enjoy

Open and long. Fun, because you get to throw distance drivers for nearly every tee shot and the course doesn't usually punish you if you're a little off.

I liked this course a lot. The way they use the river one a handful of holes is very creative. Dual tees are a nice variety bc the longs are very long. Only complaint is that it is too open and accuracy is not that important.
