Martin Hellicar, Director of BirdLife Cyprus, stated: “The proposals included in the amendment would be completely counterproductive to anti poaching and illegal bird trapping efforts and we call the plenary of the Cyprus Parliament to vote against this bill. Just as the European Commission has done repeatedly, BirdLife Cyprus also calls the Cyprus Government to immediately start the implementation of the agreed Strategic Action Plan with the removal of the ‘alternative plan’ and to take serious action against restaurants illegally serving ambelopoulia.”
Jonathan Hall, Head of UK Overseas Territories Unit of the RSPB (BirdLife in the UK), stated: “As well as the urgent need to deal with the restaurants which illegally serve ambelopoulia in the Republic of Cyprus, it is necessary to address the supply coming from the SBAs. The RSPB, as the largest nature conservation organisation in the UK, is calling on the UK Government to crack down on this activity and end the illegal-killing of songbirds in Dhekelia. This is an issue about which British people care passionately, so we expect the UK Government to take firm action”.
