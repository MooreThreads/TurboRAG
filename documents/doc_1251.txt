Vanilla Cupcakes with Chocolate Frosting
Passover really threw me for a loop. It wasn’t the guests we had visit for the holiday. It was the 100 matzo balls for my son’s third grade seder. That, plus charoset and maror for everyone at the event. My house was overtaken by a cooking frenzy last week; I focused on that and nothing else (except my children).
Now everything has calmed down and I am happily back to this blog! I have been thrilled by the amount of chat in the comments over here. I have also received so many lovely emails from people thanking me for these recipes and all I can say is –you’re welcome! It is wonderful to love what you do and ALSO be appreciated for it. That is the proverbial icing on the cupcake.
Now, I am happy to introduce.
½ cup coconut flour, sifted
½ teaspoon celtic sea salt
¼ teaspoon baking soda
6 eggs
½ cup grapeseed oil
½ cup agave nectar degrees for 20 minutes
- Cool completely
- Top with chocolate frosting
My friend Patricia claims she and her son have fought each other over these cupcakes. I hope you like them as much as she does.

Vegan Chocolate Frosting
This is my all time favorite icing recipe. Lately, I’ve been using it to frost!
1 cup dagoba chocodrops
½ cup grapeseed oil
2 tablespoons agave nectar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
pinch celtic sea salt
This gluten-free, dairy-free, rich and creamy chocolate icing will fool all of the junk food junkies, dairy-lovers and gluten gluttons in your life –they won’t have a clue that they’re eating on your meal plan. Go ahead, see for yourself.

Coconut Macaroons
Later than usual this year, my favorite spring holiday falls on April 19th, just over 3 weeks away. I especially enjoy the food traditions surrounding this holiday; during the next couple of weeks I will be posting all of my favorite Passover recipes.
Macaroons are an ideal Pesach dessert because they are made with egg whites. According to mirabilis.ca, “macaroons originated in an Italian monastery around 1792. The name comes from the Italian word for paste, maccarone, which refers to almond paste. Macaroni means flour paste.”
I make this great gluten-free Passover dessert all year round; when I retested it today, my younger son ate an entire baking sheet of these yummy little cookies!
6 egg whites
1/4 teaspoon celtic sea salt
1/2
