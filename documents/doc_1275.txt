Clinical research on acupuncture for fertility
Over thousands of years, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has displayed much success in its treatment of many diseases, in particular for fertility issues. More recently, there have been a number of clinical studies which further support the efficacy of TCM and acupuncture for fertility.
A study looking at over 4000 women found that patients undergoing treatment for fertility with a trained Chinese Medicine Practitioner were 2.
There is a study referenced by Drs. Larry Dulgosz, Michael B. Brachs, Yale University School of Medicine â€“ Epidemiologic Reviews Vol. 14, pg 83, 1992. In this study of almost 2,000 women from Connecticut, researchers found the likelihood of infertility was 55% greater in women drinking 1 cup of coffee per day. Women who drank more than 3 cups of coffee per day were 176% more likely to experience infertility.
Acupuncture seems to be a useful tool for improving pregnancy rate after ART. (Paulus W et al, Fertility and Sterility April 2002 Vol 77, pp. 721-724).
Luteal-phase acupuncture has a positive effect on the outcome of IVF/ICSI (Dieterle S et al, Fertility and Sterility May 2006 Vol 85, pp. 1347-1351).
Acupuncture on the day of embryo transfer significantly improves the reproductive outcome of IVF, compared with no acupuncture (Westergaard L et al, Fertility and Sterility April 2006 Vol 85, pp. 1341-1346).
Acupuncture can increase blood flow to the uterus (Stener-Victorin E, et al Human Reproduction Oxford Journal 1996; Vol. 11, No. 6, pp.1314-1317).
Alcohol consumption and fertility
A study from the Universality of California of 221 couples undergoing fertility treatment found:
For women alcohol consumption in the month before IVF attempt reduced success nearly 3 times with alcohol consumption in the week before egg pick up (one glass per day) increasing the chance of miscarriage by 2 times.. Fertility and Sterility 2003;79:330-339
Alcohol consumption in the week prior to conception was associated with an increased rate of miscarriage. For women ten or more drinks a week was associated with 2 to 3 times greater risk of miscarriage while for men it was 2 to 5 times greater risk.
