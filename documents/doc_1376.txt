Exchange of Heart / Munro vs. the Coyote
Sometimes Life takes onSometimes?
“Characters that will steal readers’ hearts with their humor and resilience, smooth writing, and a satisfying and hopeful ending make this a book to enjoy both emotionally and critically.”
– Kirkus Reviews
“Groth’s latest novel is an exceptionally fine counterpoint to his previous YA novel Are You Seeing Me?…(He) writes with knowledge, compassion, maturity of vision and piercing humour. His characters, created with warmth and depth — from major to minor — are idiosyncratic and lively. It is (his) deft evocation of Munro’s self-narration and the voices in his head that powerfully propels the novel.”
– Canada.com
