Teme Triangle readers singled out Jan ‘The Milk’ Young for special praise during the snow and freezing temperatures that brought most of the Teme valley to a standstill in March.
Most of Jan’s regular customers were amazed and delighted to get their milk and newspapers delivered to their door every day of the severe weather except one when blizzard conditions effectively closed most roads in the area. Jan and her milk round partner Phil Gray managed their daily 60 mile round trip on every other day, including Sunday.
“We’ve only missed two days in 30 years,” says Jan proudly. She maintains her round seven days a week to over 800 houses in the Broadheath, Clifton and Shelsleys area as well as many schools, always keeping an eye on the elderly and the vulnerable in all weather.
Growing concern about plastic pollution has brought an unexpected bonus to Jan in the form of several new customers who prefer to buy their milk in glass bottles instead of plastic containers.
Local residents have also expressed gratitude to local farmers and others who worked tirelessly to clear local roads and lanes blocked with snowdrifts.
