Working with two famous franchises with Guardians of the Galaxy and The Suicide Squad, writer and director James Gunn was able to compare the difference of working with both Marvel and DC. He shared his insights on how each treats their projects and on being the one calling the shots for the films he handled.
James Gunn is known for writing and directing for Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy films before making the jump to DC in doing the same for the upcoming standalone sequel of The Suicide Squad. His last project with Marvel would be Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 which will be releasing in 2023.
In an interview with The New York Times, James Gunn shared the difference between working with DC and Marvel. He said, "There's no doubt Kevin Feige is way more involved with editing than people are at Warner Bros. He gives more notes. You don't have to take them and I don't always take them... The truth is, as Marvel goes on and Kevin Feige starts to amass ownership of half of all film in general, he's more spread out."
He also shared that DC has a "less uniform approach" and how that is one of the main comparisons that DC can differ from Marvel. With both of the franchises heading in the direction of having their very own version of the multiverse, Gunn talked about the approaches that the studios are heading to, "The Marvel Universe has always been a little more cohesive, and DC has always had more great single runs."
His upcoming The Suicide Squad is expected to bring in more DC characters than any other film in the franchise. As for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, it is still under production and it seems that Gunn is proud with his farewell project with Marvel.
What an experience that James Gunn has had, right?
The Suicide Squad will premiere in theaters and on HBO Max on August 6, 2021. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is scheduled for release on May 5, 2023.
