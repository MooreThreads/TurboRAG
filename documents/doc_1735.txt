I intended on writing here every week at the very least. We see how that has gone, eh? See, this is the problem with taking three Literature classes and a World History class at the same time. As an example of what my life has been like, here is what I have to complete before tomorrow:
American Literature Survey: I have to read “Desiree’s Baby” by Kate Chopin and “Wife of His Youth” by Charles Chesnutt.
Intro to English Studies: We have a quiz on “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, which we have already read. Also, I have to read the intros for all the pieces in the Norton Anthology chapters 1-7, Chapter 7 of another textbook, “Rip Van Winkle” by Washington Irving, and “Story of an Hour” by Kate Chopin. It seems this is my day for Chopin stories. Heh.
Introduction to World Civilization: Test on India, China, and world philosophies.
Shakespeare: I have to read “As You Like It” Acts 1-3 and take a line recognition quiz on it.
My classes are on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the preceding was only one day of classwork. I somehow thought I would have the energy to do all this, work on my won writing, keep up with a blog, and do all my personal family stuff. I am married with four children and an elderly parent living with me. That, my friends, is what we call optimistic on an insane level.
The worst part of all this is that the ideas are still there, battering at my brain. They want out and, like Lovecraftian creatures from beyond the Abyss of space and time, they don’t care how much of my sanity they take with it. I had precious little sanity as it stood before I started taking these classes. The tragedy of it is that most of these classes would have been a joy, if I had taken them with other, less time-consuming coursework. I mean, what was I thinking taking two literature classes, a world history class, AND Shakespeare??? I love Shakespeare, but it often seems that I don’t have time to read the plays and still keep up with the other readings. Ah well, I’ll just have to do my best.
On the writing front, one of my professors announced a campus writing contest. Students can submit in any of the following categories: short story, creative nonfiction, poetry, script, play. I don’t do scripts and plays, but I have a few short stories, a couple of creative nonfiction pieces, and three poems I am considering submitting.
I was having trouble narrowing down the poetry submissions to one, then I read the fine print and saw that we were limited to three. Now I just have to narrow down my short story possibilities. My wife has a favorite story that she wants me to submit, but I don’t know if humorous dark fantasy would work for this competition. I have a supernatural story that I think might do well. It is not one of my horror or suspense stories, so I think it might fare pretty well.
I am planning on emailing one of my former professors whose opinions I trust (and who I don’t believe is one of the judges) to see what he thinks. More as this situation develops… and as I have time and energy.
