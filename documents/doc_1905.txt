“Theniel 36:25-27
Sometime back I read a fascinating account of a person who received a heart transplant, and who during his recovery found that his tastes for food had changed. It so happened he was in contact with the donor’s family, and after talking with them, found that he had acquired certain proclivities for food that had been dominant in the donor.
Until it has happened to you, it is impossible to know how it is to be changed by God, to be transformed, to have your sinful nature replaced by one of righteousness and holiness. When the Holy Ghost comes into a person and dwells there, a distinct and dynamic change in direction occurs. You have charted a new course, your vision is lifted, your spirited eyes gaze upward, you’re connected to a new world. Your interest in worldly parties wanes, gambling tables lose their fascination, to drink yourself into oblivion appears foolish and inane. You have become a new person; the spirit of God—that holy and righteous nature—has now infiltrated you. Think it not strange that godly desires and passions claw at you, that His Word and His people become precious and dear.
Relationships with people will deepen, you recognize anew your family to be priceless, and you cherish them and tend them, and think of the destination of their souls. With all wisdom and tenderness you point your loved ones to heaven.
How blessed are you—how blessed am I—we who have experienced the metamorphosis that comes from a spiritual heart transplantation. God’s spirit has entered us, His statues have become our daily directives, His holiness and righteousness have become our compass, His judgments our own.

Thank you I have enjoyed these thoughts.
Blessing and Peace.

Amen! It’s a truly wonderful thing to have Dr. Jesus perform spiritual heart surgery on you. It really does change your life for the better.
Lovely description of actual happenings. Thank you, Shirley.
Thanks for the scripture and the post. For me it has been a gradual transformation, where the doctor has been doing surgery a little at a time for 24 years. Either way, it’s a good and blessed thing.
Good evening, everyone, and again thank you for your visits and for your careful comments.
The more I think about it, the more moved I am at the transformation that comes to the person who finds God, who opens the door to his heart and who says, “Change me, Lord, change me Lord. Don’t let me stay the same. For I want to be more like you…..”
Shirley for this wonderful testimony. I trust you continue to do well.
