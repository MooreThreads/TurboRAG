Back in January, I wrote about 10 uncommon seeds that we planned to start. Of the ten only three germinated: orange scented thyme, jujube, and raisin tree and the thyme died soon after germination. That’s not as bad as it sounds; in fact, it’s excellent because it’s difficult if not impossible to find jujube and raisin tree in Canada. The eight others can be obtained from other sources.

Raisin Tree
Because the three jujubes, while starting to be pot bound, are still quite small, I’ll probably overwinter them inside this year. It’s difficult to pin down exactly how hardy they are. I’ve seen temperatures ranges of -10℉ to -20℉. Once they are large enough, they should survive here. I’ll probably do the same for the raisin tree although it’s much larger.
