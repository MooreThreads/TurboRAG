Thank you for using JustAnswer. I am researching your issue and will respond shortly.
While it's possible that this could happen, it almost certainly will not. I see time and time against payday loan companies threaten to have you arrested (which is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) for a lender to threaten).
They would have to prove criminal intent, and that's very difficult to do in a payday loan situation. The reason is that most individuals that take out a payday loan are already financially strapped, and there's a presumption that they intend to pay again.
They would need to show some additional evidence than you not paying, closing the account, etc... (which is merely a breach, not a crime).
So in short, while it's possible, it's highly highly highly improbable. I've seen many situations of these companies threaten to have you arrested, but I've never seen or heard of a situation where it has actually basically they cannot arrest me?

they might be scammer
Whether they are legit or not is a different matter.
true
They can't legally threaten you this way.
What you asked is if you can be arrested, and I would put money on the fact that you almost certainly will not.
(that it's a common tactic used by less than reputable debt collectors)).
