A body of Ekiti State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, Ekiti(APC) Restoration Group (ERG),has predicted doom for Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state, and vowed to galvanise all resources to ensure that the party reclaimed the state from the PDP during the 2018 governorship poll.
The group equally expressed deep concern over the state of affairs in the state, under the Fayose administration, saying therewas an urgent need for the party to stand up and rescue Ekiti, in the midst of the crisis trailing the various arms of government.
