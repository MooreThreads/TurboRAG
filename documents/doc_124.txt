Trip Notes
A little bit about India
Climate: The climate in Goa will be humid and tropical with occasional rainfall. Average temperatures between 25 C – 30 C.:. All the food at Samata Resort is organic and grown on site! Their chefs are incredible and will leave you consistently excited for your next meal!
What to Bring:.
A Little Bit about Modesty: Although progressive and heavily influenced by the West, India remains a modest society. Please dress with consideration.. 45 Rupees is around 1 CND dollar so no need to worry when you finish up that 1 hour long ayurvedic massage or oil treatment and it costs 1000 Rupees, that’s only $20!
Tipping: Although not an Indian custom, tipping has become common with the increase in tourism throughout the years. A 10% tip on your bill goes a long way for your server and will definitely put a smile on their face.
Extending your Trip: Sometimes when 30 days just isn’t enough time you may want to extend your return flight back to reality. Each airline has different rules in changing flights but generally this can be arranged for a reasonable fee. We will be happy to assist you with this and support your new dreams to become an Indian beach bum! E-mail us at info@breatheinlife.com to inquire about a flight.
Solo Travelers: Not a problem at all! We have many travelers who will come solo on our trainings and the casual group setting is a great environment to meet new like-minded people. When you are on a Breathe in Life training, you are always among friends! As far as your accommodations go on this training, you have several choices to choose from that vary in price. For a listing of all of the available levels of accommodation please visit our dates and prices page.
Communicating with Home: Staying connected to home is easy to do as all of the places we stay have Wi-Fi. If you have an unlocked phone you can also purchase a local sim card for a few dollars but it does take a few days to activate so do account for that.
