Increase her exercise…chances are she’s pretty sedentary, right?
There are studies being done by some physician (saw it on the news so I don’t have a URL reference, sorry) and he has shown that increasing the exercise in children causes the brain to naturally produce the stimulant the brain needs (that the medicine is doing now) to get rid or greatly reduce the ADHD symptoms.
Kids now a days are stimulated mentally but not much physically, and this is the body’s way of letting you know there’s problems…according to this physician.
But, his studies may have merit…I am an adult with ADD, and I have started exercising again regularly, and do not need the ritalin now…I just started that on my own…my physician is impressed.
Good luck!
