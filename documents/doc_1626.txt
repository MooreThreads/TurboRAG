Dr. Michael Elterman's Ratings
Be careful if you talk to Dr. Elterman! He will omit things that contradict his report. I'm going to request his notes, as suggested in another review. Also, his cell phone use during interviews and home visits is unbelievably rude.

25 Years after this pig in the public trough of providing "court-ordered reports" in custody hearings, and a pay-off by the ex-husband, "Bernie the Attorney" this liarsrecommendations and the subsequent loss of my kids is still resonating in all our lives, including the grandkids...the exhusband is a sociopath and so is Elterman...I am surprised that only one of them is coupled with my son's mother in law. Everyone knows about Elterman and yet he is still allowed to "practice". Check out articles on his over payment from government.

Stay away from him - he is not professional and never keeps the dates. He is like money making machine and doesn't care about child interests.
If he writes Section 15th Report and you are not satisfied, request his notes - usually they are contradicted to the Report

I had an excellent experience with Dr. Elterman. I was very intimidated I had to have a Section 15 report done at all (an attempt by my ex-husband to stop a move to a different province), let alone that I had to expose my daughters to it. As it turned out Dr. Elterman was a gem with the children and they had fun with him. He also saw right through my ex'es web of delusions & lies and not only was I able to move, he said it would be detrimental for them not to be in my care.

I'm afraid my experience with Dr. Elterman was also not a positive one. He was clearly swayed by the lies of my psychopathic ex-wife and took her side. He tried to put words in the mouths of my witnesses and in his report twisted what they said. My ex continued to poison my daughter's mind against me between the ages of 6 and 10 and she has since become estranged from me. Her life is now a mess. She's attempted suicide at least once and run away from home. On the personal side, I too found Dr. Elterman disheveled and unprofessional in appearance. His handshake was weak and his hands told of a man who has never done an honest days work in his life. Yet people have to pay a king's ransom for his "services."

I saw Dr. Elterman as an adult woman years ago. He was very calm and I could discuss nitty gritty unpleasant things with him, with complete ease. He was very understanding, kind, and helpful to me in helping me with past history of a sadistic, abusive father. Now many years later with my father's death, and upon discovering written documents from my father, as well as family verification, EVERYTHING Dr. Elterman said was true. I retain a warm grateful spot in my scarred heart for the words Dr. Elterman said to me so many years ago. I felt he welcomed me to sessions as if I were worth a million dollars. I am grateful to Dr. Michael Elterman.
