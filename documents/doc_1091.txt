Very nice atmosphere with friendly baristas who know how to properly make tea. (They also make coffee, of course, but I haven't tried it since I'm not a coffee person.) The shelves of evangelical Christian books on the wall were a little off putting to me since I'm not religious, but I love that donating to charity is a central part of their business.

Regarding the tea, they rather cleverly display their tea (made by Adagio) in small canisters on a magnetic rack so that you can smell them before deciding which one to try. I really appreciated the simplicity and practicality of this and wish more shops would do something similar (rather than waiting until you ask about their teas to offer to smell them). Overall, a great choice if you'd like an alternative to Starbucks in the Nashville area.
