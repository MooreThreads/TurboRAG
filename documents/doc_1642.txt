Hot Hot Heat have been added to the Sunset Junction bill. I know you know Sunset Junction, the festival spread along Silverlake's streets in late August. It's sweltering, and us indie rock fans could never quite understand how old-skool Silverlake gay men could promenade in their leathers all day long.

There's the first apricots, nectarines and peaches, along with high season cherries (which peak between Mother's Day and Father's Day) and lingering strawberries. Whole Foods already has saturn peaches and cherries, though their charging nearly nine bucks a pound, whereas at the Farmer's Market you get something around a pound for five.......Continue Reading "Summer on the Horizon"
