We're still pretty early on in the announcement of the Samsung Galaxy S 4 at Radio City in New York City, but we've already gotten a ton of information. It seems as though Samsung understands that all of the info has been leaked, so it is just running through bullet points at a break-neck pace. But, that also means we already have one of the key bits of info: the release date...
This is a discussion for a news. To read the whole news, click here

yeah, it's similar to Nvidia's 4+1 set-up but in this case it's 4+4.

overall the phone has 8 cores, but effectively it has only four at any one time

8 cores, only 4 activated at a time. I thought we were over this?

Shhhh, no logic allowed.

the sad part is that android needs the 8 cores to compete with the speed of iphone and Blackberry

Samsung have shot themselves in the foot here,android users like change. Doing an apple and re releasing the exact same phones won't sit. Won't be getting an s3 myself! Htc one maybe? Note 3 maybe?!

Yeah. Upload the photo to a service no honestly uses!
-.-
I love G+, and think it's a great Facebook substitue, but until Google becomes aggressive and integrates into Android/Chrome to the point you HAVE to use it...it will not have the FB numbers or activity.

Damn, most of the leaks are becoming legit these days.
These are all the information we knew already, Sammy's just confirming it to us.
