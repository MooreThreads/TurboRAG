All-New Dodge Journey Gets Cash-Back Offer

Dodge Journey Rockets to First in Incentives (Jalopnik)
A $1,000? I'm sure if one waits a little longer it will rise to $1,500 or $2,000. Why anyone would buy anything from Chrysler these days is beyond me. The Mgt team is only trying to raise sales so they can unload the company. There is a good article in this months Forbes describing Chrysler's history of false promises and how the Mgt team are not car people with the exception of Jim Press from Toyota. Then again he came aboard because they gave him $150 million in options.
Stick a fork in Chrysler.

Not surprised at all to see incentives on this car. Not really a bad car, until you get into the drivers seat. What were they thinking with those tiny, retro 80's gauges? If I were shopping for this type of car, this would not even be on the list.

Don't forget; sometimes automakers offer cash back on brand-new models as a way to get consumers into them. There are a lot of 3-row SUVs out there, and a lower price may be the best bet for Chrysler to get people into the Journey.

Have you seen the interior? It's CRAP! $1,000 cash back, but I'd still have to live with that stinker for 5+ years. No thanks

I would care about Jaguar and Land Rover being sold by Ford to Tata before I care about another Chrysler product getting incentives for a newly introduced vehicle. Why? That happens all the time!

Personally, I liked the looks of the Journey when I saw it at an auto show a few weeks ago. I was impressed with the features and options it has and it's a good price for a crossover. I'd really like to see the incentive trigger sales of the vehicle.

Actually I like the Journey, not sure about a brand new car, probably I would wait until 10 when the bugs are over. By the way, here in South Texas Toyota is selling the FJ's and truck with HUGE discounts, so probably everybody is trying to sell cars. Honda doesn't seem to have huge rebates and some GMC cars like the Outlook/Acadia are doing well.

They will need more than $1000 to compensate for the 4 speed automatic (with the 2.4).

I bought a Journey SXT with the 3.5L, AWD, third row seating, and six speed automatic. My chief motivators for purchase of this car were:
1. Third row seating... the third row has limited space, but I've got a ten year old, a 7 year old and an 8 month old. It's perfect for us.
2. AWD: I live in a rural snow-covered area and we got a bunch of snow right after I bought it. This car works better in the snow than my F250 4X4.
3. Warranty. By default, this has a 3 year, 36 month bumper to bumper warranty and a lifetime powertrain warranty. I took it upon myself to purchase the Chrysler extended bumper-to-bumper lifetime warranty for a couple thousand.
Interior? Cheap-looking? Yep. But it seems durable and easy to clean. Also, gauges and everything are easily accessible. The car rides beautifully absorbing most bumps... even on my poorly maintained gravel roads.
What don't I like... First, it could get better mileage. Mine was listed at 23 mpg. I don't believe I've gotten that yet.
Second, those 19" tires look to be quite expensive when I need to replace them.

Good luck getting that extended bumper-to-bumper lifetime warranty honored by the new owner after Cerberus dumps Chrysler. You wasted a couple thousand dollars.
