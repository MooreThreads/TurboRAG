Thanks for swinging by! If you’re interested in infusing spirit + soul into your business, you’re in the right place!
I’m Kristen – a soulful business strategist. I stopped hanging up my coat in some of the biggest marketing agencies so I could help spirit-led entrepreneurs add more ease, joy and profits into their daily life.
Let’s give up the hustle. Let’s find sacred success together.
Stop waiting for the right insights to come through – your business already has them!
Wouldn’t it be nice if your business could just tell you how to best grow it?
If it could whisper in your ear who your next clients are?
If you could reach five and six figure program closes…without even needing to launch?
Tapping into the soul of my business has been one of the greatest tools for my success.
Seriously. My business has shown me which offers are ready to accept clients, and which ones are still forming. I’ve learned about a new offer I was launching and started receiving energy for it for months before I had any plans of opening up the doors to new clients.
Now, tapping into the soul of my business is crucial for any launch. Because, sure, I could go through a giant launch process (and don’t get me wrong, I’m one of those weirdos that LOVES launches!)…but it’s a whole lot easier to simply message the 5-10 people that are energetically committed to be in a program, mention that I saw them in the soul of my business, and let the magic unfold. Not only does that create five and six figure “launches” without the launch part…but it gives me complete confidence that my clients are in the program that’s most aligned for them, and that they WILL get amazing results.
From here there is unlimited access to the exact (unique for you) guidance you need to create sold out offerings at the perfect price point, feel confident raising your rates, know what to write in your copy, and what strategies to focus on. Her in depth knowledge of effective business strategy and genius intuition will support you in growing your business with total alignment and true magic.Allison Braun
🔮The Money Room to create a safe space for money to enter your business, and open up the doors to receiving it. It’s hard to bring in the abundance + prosperity if your business feels like the home of a pauper (or doesn’t feel safe or secure!)
🔮Calling In Soulmate Clients to create designated space for clients in your business – and send out the energetic beacon to help them find their way in. (Because it’s a whole lot easier to sell to someone that’s already connected to the soul of your business, than to try to selling to everyone!)
🔮 The Expansion Room to make more room in your business for growth + receiving. You’ll make room for more clients to come into your business, and bring them into the one offer that’s asking for energy right now. (And if you don’t know what that offer is, that’s okay – your business will tell you!)
🔮The Energetic Client Connection to discover how your incoming clients will best connect to you + how to draw their energy in. Because why waste time doing allllll the things, when they just need to hear from you in one way to get pulled into your magnetic energy?
🔮 The Clearing Warrior to remove any negative energy from your business + create a protective barrier to prevent any other negativity from coming in Because you clean your house weekly…but how often does your business get cleaned? Is it still holding onto the energy of launches you consider flops? Of clients that weren’t aligned? Of criticism from haters. Let’s clear out all the shit + create a protective field around your business so it can grow without all the heaviness.
