Today was a day of giving back and sprucing up.
The Delaware Center for Horticulture 2017 Regional Intern Outreach Day brought together more than 130 horticulturists, interns, and staffers from fifteen organizations throughout Wilmington and beyond to give some tender loving care to public landscapes.
Wheelbarrows, clippers, and gloves peppered the grounds outside DCH and nearby parks as workers joined forces, in the sweltering heat, to plant, remove weeds, and uncover blooming flowers beneath debris.
The day is designed “to bring interns together, not only as a learning experience, but as an opportunity to give back through service learning,” said Vikram Krishnamurthy, DCH’s Executive Director.
By connecting with experts in the field, as well as each other, the interns also had the opportunity to grow their professional networks, while serving the community in a meaningful way.
Several parks including Wilmington’s Conaty Park, Rattlesnake Run in Brandywine State Park, E.D. Robinson Urban Farm, and the Delaware Center as well as the 9/11 memorial garden benefited from today’s events.
