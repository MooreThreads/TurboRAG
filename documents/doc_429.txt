GRAND RAPIDS – Gov. Rick Snyder appears ready to tap Varnum LLP, one of West Michigan's largest law firms, as a partner for another next leg of his economic development agenda.
A media advisory sent this afternoon says Snyder plans to announce the MiSpringboard program, “a new service that will be offered for Michigan start-up businesses,” Wednesday at 11:30 a.m..
While not specified on the advisory, MiSpringboard is the same name used by Grand Rapids-based Varnum for a Twitter account focused on supporting Michigan start-up firms.
“Michigan. Entrepreneurs. Jobs. Free. Help. Growth. To be announced June 2011,” a description line tied to the Twitter account reads.
The web address mispringboard.com leads to a currently inactive page on Varnum's corporate website.
Pure Michigan Business Connect is Snyder's $3 billion economic development initiative announced last week that includes state incentives for start ups and business expansion, a collateral matching program, a $2 billion commitment to lend to Michigan businesses by Huntington Bank and a website that helps serve as a clearinghouse for businesses in need of help as they grow.
Stay tuned to Mlive.com and its partner papers for coverage of the announcement.
