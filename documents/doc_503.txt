The other two books sound fascinating - especially the The Family Under the Bridge. My daughter would especially love it -she and her husband lived in Paris for 10 months. Thank you, Michelle - I love discovering books I haven't read!!! WendyLady@GoodBooks - I agree, agree, agree! (except I've neve...Oh - I agree, agree, agree! (except I've never read Harry Potter, so I can't comment on Mr. Weasley). I especially adore Mr. Penderwick, Mr. Moody & Mr. Gilbreth - oh and Captain Crewe AND Mr. Ingalls. Great list - even the honorable mentions!<br /><br />I also love: Mr. Woodlawn from Caddie Woodlawn; Father in The Winged Watchman; and Armand from The Family Under the Bridge (although he's not technically a father, he grows into that role during the book).<br /><br />Happy Father's Day~<br /><br />~MichelleMichelle
