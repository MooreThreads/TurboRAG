Why do you format your Macs upon purchase? Dude, its not a Dell.

Wow, I was actually in the same situation when my MacBook came in recently. Thanks for the tip, I probably should’ve figured it out myself.

I just upgraded from to Leopard using CPU Drop-in DVD (product # 22691-6040-A) a few minutes ago and I was just thinking about how I would have preferred to do a clean wipe-and-install.
Next time I’ll try this, thanks!

Thankx! My drop-in dvd DOES require a pre-installed version of OSX, 10.4, so this is helpfull!

I prefer to install it on an external HD and boot it off firewire. Great tutorial though!

hi, to do the same with the Tiger Upgrade DVD, which file would I need to delete? I didn’t find any “CheckForOSX” File.

Hello,
i tried this trick, but when it comes to deleting this checkforosx file, I go to ‘volumes’ as specified, but find 0 files in there…
Where did it go wrong?
thanx in advance,
schokkie

I followed the steps mentioned above but could not find the CheckforosX-file, after looking around I found it in /System/installation/CDIS/ view package Os X installer:
Contents/resources.
Good luck

Hi again, I might have been misunderstood.
Can anybody point to where the checkforosx file is located on the TIGER Upgrade DVD?

On the TIGER Upgrade DVD I found the file here: System/Installation/Packages/Essentials.pkg/Contents/Resources/CheckForOSX
However I couldn’t delete the file. I get an error that I don’t have “sufficient privileges”
What can I do?
Regards
Henning
