Werewolf: Auld Lang Syne
Rites
Modified Rites
Rite of Talisman Dedication
This isn’t really a change so much as a delineation of some of the more bulky items of clothing and Gnosis ‘costs.’ Yeah I’m being a bit of a hard nose about it (yep, low rank Garou don’t get to ‘look cool’ until they get more Gnosis). Werewolves tearing clothes (and the clues and whatnot left behind) plus the inconvenience of waking up naked is a pretty big part of the Werewolf myth, I don’t want to just toss it.
- General Clothing
- ‘Set of Clothes’ = 2 Gnosis
- Specifically 1 shirt and 1 pair pants/skirt however it includes:
- Bib-Front Overalls/Trenchcoat = 2 Gnosis
- “Workman’s coveralls,” full body stockings/bodysuits, Great Kilt = 3 Gnosis
- A Pair of Gloves = 2 Gnosis
- Hats of most any kind = 1 Gnosis
- Footwear
- Pair of sandals/moccasins/flipflops/etc. (socks included if it matters) = 2 Gnosis
- Pair of normal hard/raised heel shoes/hiking boots (includes the socks) = 3 Gnosis
- Pair of tall boots (includes the socks) = 4 Gnosis
- Natural Materials (Wool/Cotton/Linen/Leather/Silk/etc.)
- Just being made of natural materials/fibers reduces the Gnosis cost by one, to a minimum of 1.
- Figure up total Gnosis cost of General Clothing and then subtract this discount if, in the Storyteller’s opinion, the overwhelming majority of the above was natural materials. Similarly total up footwear, and then apply the discount. General Clothing and Footwear are tabulated separately
- Being handmade by a Garou (or Garou’s spiritually aware kinfolk) from natural materials reduces total cost by 2, to a minimum of 0 (be it a Wendigo’s new pair of hand made beaded moccasins or Fianna Kinfolk hand shearing/dying/weaving/waulking tartan wool). In effect, this allows the item to (once the Rite is performed) get away with the Fetish/Talen loophole of being partially spiritual already.
- No exception for Glasswalkers and Bone Gnawers… natural materials only. Now if they start with raw ore and smelt/refine themselves… that’s still “natural.”
- The use of Gifts like Reshape Object are perfectly fine.
- Figure up total Gnosis cost of General Clothing and then subtract this discount if, in the Storyteller’s opinion, the overwhelming majority of the above was handmade of natural materials. Similarly total up footwear, and then apply the discount. General Clothing and Footwear are tabulated separately
- Containers
- A backpack/briefcase/shoulderbag/purse/sporran = 1 Gnosis
- A duffel bag/large gym bag/hockey equipment bag/one saddlebag = 2 Gnosis
- A body bag that allows you to dump out bodies and whatnot without recasting the Rite = buy it as a 1 Point Fetish instead
- Container Contents
- Whatever’s fully contained in the pockets of clothing or within the container at the time the Rite is performed are included. With all containers, if something is “added” to the list of things dedicated in the container, the Rite must be redone. Things can be taken out/lost/used up. Players should record these Dedicated Items on their record sheets separately (or note them as dedicated).
Remember with the following items, a Fetish/Talen doesn’t require Rite of Talisman Dedication. This is just for normal/mundane items.
- Protective Gear
- Helmets = 3 Gnosis or Soak Value + 2 Gnosis whichever is higher
- Armor = Soak Value + 2 Gnosis
- Light Shield/Buckler/Targe = 2 Gnosis
- Medium Shield (Hoplite/Knight/Riot/etc.) = 3 Gnosis
- Tower Shield = 4 Gnosis
- Melee Weapons
- Up to the size of a hand-and-a-half sword = 1 Gnosis
- two-handed swords and polearms = 2 Gnosis
- Ranged Weaons
- Bow of any size = 1 Gnosis
- Guns (include 1 full load of ammo at the time of the casting of the Rite)
- Revolver = 1 Gnosis
- Semiauto Pistol = 2 Gnosis
- Submachine Gun/Carbine/etc. = 3 Gnosis
- Longarms (Shotgun/Rifle/Combat Rifle/etc.) = 4 Gnosis
- Light/Medium Squad Level Machine Guns = 5 Gnosis
- More Ammo
- Box of ammo (up to 50 rounds) = 1 Gnosis
- “Cowboy” Ammo Belt/Bandolier = 1 Gnosis
- Belt Fed Ammo/Case of Ammo = 1 Gnosis per 50 rounds
- If the Garou / Aware Kinfolk hand reloads the ammo, after figuring up total cost in Gnosis for all firearms and ammo, reduce by 1 Gnosis
