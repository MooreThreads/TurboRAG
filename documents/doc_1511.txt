Bio
Perry the Platypus, codenamed Agent P, is Phineas and Ferb's pet platypus. Unknown to his owners, he lives a double life as a secret agent for the O.W.C.A. (The Organization Without a Cool Acronym) a.k.a. "The Agency". The Agency is a government organization of animal spies. In the Agency, his immediate superior is Major Monogram. He is assigned to thwart the plans of the self-proclaimed "evil" Dr. Heinz Doofenschmirtz. They are best described as frenemies-sometimes helping each other, other times they're bitter enemies.
Perry was adopted at an animal shelter run by the O.W.C.A. by the Flynn-Fletcher Family. According to Phineas, Perry was chosen because he looked at both Phineas and Ferb at the same time. When they adopted the platypus, he was given the name "Bartholomew" before he was renamed "Perry".
Perry is normally found acting like a mindless platypus in front of his owners, Phineas and Ferb. He is also serious while not undercover, even in front of Major Monogram. Perry also deeply cares about the Flynn-Fletcher family and is afraid to lose them and would take immediate action whenever they are threatened.
