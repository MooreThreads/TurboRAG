Steps to ripping out acrylic shower stall enclosure and covering with tiles?
I really am just guessing here so please help, lol...
1. Remove drain plate and unscrew shower spicket
2. Cut all caulk with a blade
3. Somehow (really need help here) remove the enclousure
4. Install cememt board with special screws
5. Latex caulk between cement board seams
6. Appy thinset and v-notch it
7. Install tiles with spacers
8. Grout (not sure what type to use)
9. Possibly spray on sealer to just the grout or the entire surface?
Just thought of a few more things...Going to need a "hump" on the floor to keep water in, Frame it with 2x4s and cover it with cement board?
Blah, another thing I just thought have, I already have a tiled floor, I assume I have to keep the same tile design as the floor?

Do you want to change over from an acrylic base to a mortar based shower ? From the post questions and scenario you plan out, this is not something you should do. Have someone who has experience do the base. You can prep and tile the walls with some changes in methodology.
You need a vapor barrier behind the cement board. The seams are sealed with thinset and fiberglass tape designed for cementboard. No latex caulk in the shower area at all. If you pick wall tiles for the wall, they have lugs that build in the spacing. If you want to alter the designed gaps, then use the spacers. If the grout lines are 1/8" or less, use unsanded grout. Over 1/8", use sanded grout. Seal just the grout. If sealer gets on the glazed tile it needs to be washed off.
The surround will be glued to the walls. Use a flat bar or crow bar to remove it. If it's resistant, cut the sheetrock and remove it in pieces.
