Today over lunch, my friend Amal Kirtan asked me how I'm finding his home country of Brazil.
"I am feeling so deeply fortunate." I replied. "Amazed. The devotees here seem to live with their hearts on their sleeves. They give their whole hearts in service. No walls."
"Indeed, Brazilians have very open hearts," Amal Kirtan agreed.
"Yes! But I am wondering, Prabhu - if their hearts are so open, don't their hearts also get hurt much more easily?"
Amal Kirtan shook his head, "Brazilians have very strong hearts. It's very hard to break a Brazilian heart,"
My eyes widened and I leaned forward in my seat. "But why? How come??"
"Brazilians give and love with all their hearts, and if it gets hurt they also let it go. They know how to let go."
I leaned back in my seat. "Wow. They don't get so bitter or angry,"
"No, that's American!" Amal Kirtan laughed, and I laughed, too.
Brazilians seem to live the open secret: let love flow.
