With South Beach becoming the center of the basketball universe after LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh agreed to sign with the Miami Heat, the curiosity has been piqued of the remaining free agents about the potential dynasty being put together in the ‘Sunshine State’.
In fact, the interest is at such a high level that even a member of the defending NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers can’t resist taking a peek.
According to ESPNLA.com, Lakers free agent point guard Derek Fisher is scheduled to meet with Heat president Pat Riley on Saturday.
Fisher's preference remains to re-sign with the Lakers, but he feels the need to explore his options and listen to Riley's pitch as Los Angeles general manager Mitch Kupchak continues to work on an offer that is satisfactory to the five-time NBA Champion.
If it were up to Kobe Bryant though, Fisher would have been locked up by the Lakers well before any meetings were scheduled with other organizations.

Although Fisher will listen to what Riley and the Heat have to offer, the Lakers are confident the 14-year veteran will eventually re-sign with the organization.
However, Mitch Kupchak would be best served not to allow this situation to linger because Riley has proven to be extremely persuasive when push comes to shove. Just ask Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James.
