- The BEST for your hands... Review by DBK
- My husband and I both have extremely dry hands in the winter time, and this is the only product we have found that works without making our hands greasy and grimy feeling. It's light, fragrance-free, and makes your hands feel totally soft and moisturized. (Posted on 4/6/15)
- The best hand lotion on the market! Review by Katzenjammerz

- Cannot live without it! Review by Beth
- Hands down one of the best hand creams you could use in those cold months. It 's fast absorbing, not greasy and has a light scent. I love that I can use it while I am driving and throw my hands right back onto the wheel because it absorbs THAT FAST!

- Better Than a Prescription Review by illbbax
- 8 years ago, I took a position up north while I was living in Tampa, Florida. The skin on my hands would crack in the dry, cold winters of Dayton, Ohio.
I was close to going to a dermatologist for help; then a friend of mine was doing some Christmas shopping and I went along. She went to an apothecary and I asked if there was something I could put on my hands as a man, that would not have an un-masculine scent.
I was directed to the Quince Hand Lotion #007 and have used it religiously ever since. I am a believer in this product. Anyone who complains about the price, doesn't realize how long lasting the tube is, how well it works, and how much a comparable product would cost from a pharmaceutical company prescribed by a doctor or pharmacist.
If you're working on those new rigs in the Dakotas, try it, you'll love it. (Posted on 3/31/13)
- Only thing that work Review by Producer Bill
- I have dry hands, and I spend tons of time working with them however most hand lotions leave a greasy feeling. This doesn't and it heals my hands. Forget wondering if it will work. I am telling you right now it does and is well worth the cost. (Posted on 2/16/13)

- GREAT Review by butterfly6801
- I love this for hands, but even more than that I love it for my elbows. It keeps my elbows so soft, I have been out of it for about a month and my elbows really miss it. I can't wait until it's back in stock!!!!! (Posted on 1/16/13)
- Favorite lotion ever Review by Sam
- This is absolutely my favorite hand lotion ever, for two key reasons. First, it's silky and moisturizes really well, but unlike other effective moisturizers, it's not heavy or greasy. Most hand lotions either feel super-slippery or make your hands feel dirty afterwards because they're so heavy. This hits the Goldilocks zone.
Second, it has a fresh citrus-y smell that gives you a pick me up and then GOES AWAY. I'm not a huge scent person so don't like heavy, perfumed hand lotions that stay with you for ages. This is just enough to give a nice whiff of a refreshing scent while you're rubbing it in and then you can go back to your day.
So really, it's perfect. I actually go on and on about this lotion so much that once I was in the NY store at the counter and a woman behind me picked it up to look at it, and I started telling her how great it was until she decided to buy it. Because I had basically just sold a bottle of lotion, the sales lady who was ringing me up slyly put extra samples in my bag. So great lotion AND great store! (Posted on 6/1/12)
