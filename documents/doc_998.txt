Remaining are issues tracked at mentioned dashboard.
Those need investigation, report, fix, and rescheduling.

I was correct 30615 out of 30670 are due to the missing mount point from worker03.
Those need investigation, report...
That's a start, [1] for details:

One of the error was a mount point missing on one worker, it might be the biggest error occurrence's reason (need to check).
I was correct 30615 out of 30670 are due to the missing mount point from worker03.
Next step would be to simply extract the listing and reschedule those.
The other errors are most probably issues in the current mercurial loader and should be dealt with in new tasks.

As other loader failure report, here is a better output:
cat mercurial.output.txt | python3 -m group_by_exception --loader-type hg | jq . { "googlecode": { "total": 30670, "errors": { "Failed to uncompress archive": 30620, "'Worker exited prematurely: signal 9 (SIGKILL).',)": 20, "OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory": 11, "psycopg2.extensions.TransactionRollbackError: deadlock detected": 7, "ValueError: non-hexadecimal number found in fromhex": 4, "TypeError: 'SimpleBlob' object does not support item assignment": 2, "ValueError: could not convert string to float": 2, "empty or missing revlog for": 1, "ValueError: Branch aliases unresolved": 1, "OSError(timeout('timed out'": 1, "KeyError": 1 } }, "unknown": { "total": 2, "errors": { "psycopg2.extensions.TransactionRollbackError: deadlock detected": 2 } } }
