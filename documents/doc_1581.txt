Hedge Trimmer Reviews
We have reviewed the top models in each category of hedge trimmers. We did this by reading hundreds of customer reviews, weighing pro’s and con’s of all the models. We were able to make an honest judgement out of this information because we have so much experience using these machines on a daily basis in our landscaping business.
It is impossible to name one best hedge trimmer for everybody. This is because anybody who is looking to purchase a new hedge trimmer, has specific needs and a different intended purpose.
Firstly, I have identified all these different categories of hedge trimmers. There are different ways one can classify hedge trimmers. One can either divide them by power type, which is what is most commonly done.
Another way is to classify hedge trimmers by their intended purpose. Examples of this are the best hedge trimmer for tall hedges, or the best hedge trimmer for thick branches.
Another categorization can be the type of people intending to use the hedge trimmer. For example, during my research I found that people often search for the best hedge trimmer for women, or the best hedge trimmer for elderly people.
I have attempted to take all of these classifications into consideration in an attempt to find the best hedge trimmer for anyone. In this article I will list them all, along with a short description and a link to their respective pages.
I really hope you find my efforts useful, and I hope you will be able to find the ideal hedge trimmer for your individual needs.
Main Types Of Hedge Trimmers
Hedge trimmers come with different power sources. The power source that is best suited for your individual needs, will depend on a few factors. We will go over them in a little more detail in each sub section.
The first thing that is important to consider is how much hedge you’ll be working on. Basically, how big is the job going to be? Will it simply be a matter of trimming a couple of bushes or hedges once or twice a year, or will you be cleaning up acres of land?
Once you have that question answered, you’ll be able to get a good idea for how much power you will need in a hedge trimmer. Most people will only make this main distinction. It will be specific enough to be able to choose a good model of hedge trimmer for your needs.
I think the power source for your new hedge trimmer is an easy choice to make, especially if you already have some experience with hedge trimmers or other types of outdoor power tools.
Best Gas Hedge Trimmer
Gas powered hedge trimmers are probably the most recognizable for most people. For most people, when they imagine a hedge trimmer, they imagine a purring little gas engine, perhaps with some smelly smoke lingering around. That is probably the largest drawback right there. The lingering smoke.
When you are using a hedge trimmer, you will always have the machine close to your body, there is no way around that. Often times you will even have the trimmer at eye level, because that is the height a lot of hedges are cut at.
The result of this is, that you will be inhaling the smoky pollutants constantly while working with the machine. During my time as a professional landscaper, I sometimes found this unbearable.
Another huge drawback is the weight of these machines. When you first lift them up, the weight is not that bad. But remember, you will have to use this machine for extended periods of time. Adding to the discomfort, is the position you have to hold the hedge trimmer in.
To do any kind of proper job, you will often have to hold the trimmer away from your body, in a horizontal or vertical position. If you do not hold the trimmer level, your hedge will look terrible as a result.
This position is extremely taxing on the body, especially for those not used to the position. I would even go as far as to say that gas powered hedge trimmers are not suitable for home owners.

Conclusion
Overall, the kind of trimmer that is right for you will depend on your needs and what you value most. If you need a lot of power, then a gas-powered hedge trimmer is the way to go. If you have an interest in environment-friendly options, then the electric trimmers are absolutely worth looking into.
If you don’t want to drag around a cord, then a battery-powered hedge trimmer is going to be the ideal fit. In any of these options, if you will be trimming branches that are tall, or need to be able to reach the tops of your hedges, then it’s worthwhile to look into your options for a pole trimmer. In their own way, each trimmer is a very useful tool. It all depends on what you need it for.
