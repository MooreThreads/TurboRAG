Have the Talk
How.
Tips for starting or continuing a conversation
- Don't stress over how or when you will have the talk. A conversation with your loved one should feel relaxed and natural. It can happen at any time or place that feels comfortable..
- You can have the talk with anyone who matters to you: a parent, grandparent, spouse, aunt, uncle or close friend.
- Rely on open-ended questions that require more than a one-word answer, such as: "Describe the time...," "Tell me about...." or "How did you feel when..." Ask follow-up questions to draw out more details.
- During your conversation, your loved one may want to talk about something they have never shared before. Listen carefully with an open mind and heart. Avoid passing judgement.
- If you mention a topic that your loved one is uncomfortable discussing, respect his or her wishes and move on. Your loved one may have other reasons for not wanting to share a part of their story. They may, however, be willing to revisit the topic later.
- Family photos, heirlooms and other treasured items may help start a conversation and bring memories flooding back.
- Just start talking. While the conversation may not go exactly as you'd planned, enjoy it. Your loved one may have things to share that you haven't thought about. No matter where your talk leads, you will walk away with memories and stories can treasure for a lifetime..
