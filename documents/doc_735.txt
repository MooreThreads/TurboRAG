ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Hitting coach Jim Eppard and bench coach Rob Picciolo will not return to the Los Angeles Angels next season.
Eppard became the Angels' hitting coach early in the 2012 season. Picciolo had been Scioscia's bench coach for three seasons.
The Angels missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season despite one of the majors' largest payrolls. Los Angeles finished 78-84, its lowest win total in a decade.
Owner Arte Moreno has made no public statements about the fate of Scioscia and Dipoto, his second-year GM.
Scioscia is under contract until 2018. He is the longest-tenured manager in baseball with 14 seasons.
