Cajun Cafe on the Bayou: Spring Craft Ale Festival 2014
There will be plenty of food, including the usual Cajun plate of food: Jambalaya, Crawfish Cornbread, Red Beans & …Rice and Creole Marinated Pork. Also, like last year, we’re making 1200 bacon wrapped sausages, 600 bacon wrapped pineapple chunks, cheese and Crackers, bread pudding and more. There will be water and soda on hand to keep hydrated!
You get a souvenir glass and the event is 90% under cover so no worries with rain or too much sun.
We have plenty of knowledgeable pourers who will be on hand to let you know what you are drinking as well. As we get closer we’ll list beers and breweries that are taking part!
