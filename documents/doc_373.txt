Two incidents of proxy voting reported from Chickpet and Bommanahalli in Bangalore and some persons were held with regard.
Polling in Periyapatna constituency in Mysore district has been put off to May 28 following the death of the BJP candidate.
Today’s polling would decide the fate of Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar (Hubli-Central), the former Chief Ministers H D Kumaraswamy (Ramanagaram), B.S. Yeddyurappa (Shikaripur), Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah (Varuna), State Congress chief G Parameshwara (Koratagere), Deputy Chief Ministers R.Ashok (Padmanabhanagar), K.S. Eshwarappa (Shimoga), and several Ministers and former Ministers of various political parties are in the fray.
A total of 2,770 male and 170 female candidates have entered the electoral battle. Any party seeking to form government on its own has to secure at least 113 seats to obtain a simple majority.
A Very good turnout but why the rest has not utilized their vote?
what is so called successful ECI doing in this regard?
So much has been done by EC for a 100% voter turnout but still It should be at least 90%. And ECI is evidently very lethargic is not bothering about the 100% polling.
This is a structural and institutional issue. In India the rest 20% who has not cast their vote were probably out of their home constituencies and dont have adequate user friendly system to cast their vote.
This is the sad realty of Indian Electoral system. The educated who stay away from their home, who constitute the rest 20% are not casting their vote. Wake-up ECI.
Hats off to the Election commission of India for having a peaceful
election in the state of Karnataka. But the voter turn out was not quite
impressive like last assembly election, even being a holiday. The
commission should have arranged more awareness programs in Karnataka to
educate people about their right to exercise their franchise. The
Election commission should also contemplate the option of compulsory
voting in India as the present voter turnout in the state may not be
reflecting the general notion of the people of Karnataka.
Voters do not get their voting slips to go to the polling booth.When people go to the polling booth which they had voted earlier they find they are shifted to some other place. They are made to go many places before they find their correct place.It is suggested that election commission should take the responsibility to distribute the slips to the voters. They should not leave it to the political parties to distribute the the slips.
If the winning candidate gets less than 35% a re-poll should be
conducted. Because the 35% were against this election policy.
Let's hope for the party that is going to win may pave the way to
formulate for the welfare of people of the state.
