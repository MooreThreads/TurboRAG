While Kate Moss is renowned for her effortless fashion, the supermodel always dresses with intent. Since opening her eponymous modeling agency in 2016, Moss has evolved her off-duty wardrobe to reflect her status as an entrepreneur. Though she's traded her cutoffs and concert-tees for little structured blazers and slim trousers, Moss still references her rebellious side. Yesterday in London, she did so via a shout out to the art world's ultimate rebel, Jean-Michel Basquiat. While shopping in Hampstead, Moss kept things casual in a coat from Coach's recently launched collaboration with the artist's estate. Covered in sections from his paintings, AO AO, 1980 Jack Johnson, 1982, Peter and the Wolf, 1985 and Untitled, 1986 the piece was a creative update to the classic trench.
For an avid collector like Moss, who incorporates plenty of contemporary art painting and photography into her interior design passion, Coach's conversation piece aligns with her interests. Though the 46-year-old model rose to prominence in the â€™90s, years after Basquiat's life was tragically cut short, she clearly appreciates his work.
Moss kept things simple beneath her statement coat. The nondescript black leggings, gray sweater, and vintage cowboy boots kept the focus on the trench and its radical beauty. A Chanel 2.55 purse from her expansive bag collection completed the look, anchoring the outfit with a classic from another of her favorite creators.
