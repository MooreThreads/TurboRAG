Before long, you will have a cadre of high-powered Pokemon and likely a few gym captures to your name. Yet, there's always more to learn. Here are a few closing miscellaneous hints to help you before you set out.
A Pokemon's power is measured by its CP, and Pokemon with higher CP will more often than not outmatch a Pokemon with lower CP. Nevertheless, you always have the option to evolve or power up a Pokemon with candies and stardust to raise its CP.

For every Pokemon you defeat at a competing gym, you'll knock down the gym's stature amount, and your Pokemon will obtain expertise. So, even if you fail to defeat every Pokemon at a gym, you can nevertheless whittle down the gym's stature, and make it simpler for other trainers on your own team to take it around. Again, teamwork pays off!
To ensure that an allied gym does not fall into enemy hands, you can raise its amount to add more Pokemon. A level 2 gym, for example, can hold two Pokemon. Each player can just delegate one Pokemon per gym. If a friendly gym is only at level 1, you can increase its prestige by defeating the defending Pokemon with just one of your choosing. Conquering them will increase the gym's stature and once it reaches the next level, you or another player, will have the ability to add a Pokemon. The higher the gym amount means more Pokemon will be defending it --- that also means it'll be more demanding for the enemy team to claim it.
Pokemon have specific weaknesses and resistances. Pay attention to the types of Pokemon you are going up against, and the attacks your Pokemon know. Each Pokemon understands two attacks --- a basic assault and a particular assault --- that have a type associated with them.

So, maybe do not leave you're maximum amount Pokemon behind --- they could be gone for a long time. You can just gather these bonus things every 20 hours.
Walk, don't ride: Not only is this extremely dangerous and risky to others, your finding skills will endure due to your lack of focus. If you need to catch a Pokemon while driving, bring a buddy along to play in the passenger seat.

Going too fast can also cause Pokestops to stop working properly, and can prove challenging when you're attempting to cover more distance.
Two Pokemon of exactly the same species will not always know the precise same attacks. You may have a Pidgey with peck, and another with fishing gear. Keep that in mind when building your team. As you strike, miniature blue bars under your Pokemon's well-being gauge will fill up. Once they're full, you can unleash special moves by pressing and holding down on your own Pokemon. Special attacks do more damage than regular attacks.
If you manage to beat all the Pokemon at a given gym and lower its prestige to zero, you'll can take over it. You will need to assign a Pokemon to defend the gym, and if multiple trainers in your team add Pokemon (depending on the gym degree), the one with the maximum CP becomes the gym leader.

Be aware that setting a Pokemon in a gym means it'll be unavailable until it is defeated and returned to you.
