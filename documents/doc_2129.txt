"Johnson"
Complete as many rounds as you can in 20 minutes of:
245 lb Deadlift, 9 reps (I did 105#)
8 Muscle ups (subbed Dips w/1" band)
155 lb Squat Clean, 9 reps (65#)
4 rounds + 5 deadlifts
I'm happy. The weight was heavy. The squat cleans were crazy. I don't think I had ever established a PR, but knowing that my PR on the power clean is 75#, I thought 65#s would be good weight to keep the intensity up, while still doing a heavy load. By round 3 rep 4, I was getting tired and was cleaning the bar then squatting, which takes more energy vs. just catching the bar in a squat position. After the 20 mins were up, I felt completely drained. I could have sat on the gym floor for an hour, but I knew Diso was wanting to get going with his day with his parents.
While I was getting my Johnson on, the Crossfit 101 class was doing the 21-15-9 deadlift-squat-push up sandwiched between 200m run WOD... They all finished under 8mins, so for 12 mins they got to watch me suffer as I lifted heavy shit--- doing a WOD by yourself is a total mind fuck. I guess that's what I get for being a slacker and not making it to 8AM class.
I think I'm going to spend most of the day napping.
