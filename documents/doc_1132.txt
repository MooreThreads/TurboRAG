Yesterday, Secretary Clinton delivered a major foreign policy speech.
Of course, it prompted flashbacks of the infamous Russian Reset …
Back in March 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov with a small green box with a ribbon.
Inside was a red button with the Russian word “peregruzka” printed on it.
Clinton offered that pushing it would “reset our relationship” … ostensibly, for the better.
So, how did that all work out?
======
“Just 1% of Russians approved of U.S. leadership in 2015 — the worst rating in the world last year and the lowest approval Gallup has measured for the U.S. in the past decade.”
======
Ironically, there was a typo on the button.
Lavrov told Clinton at the time that “perezagruzka” was the Russian word for reset … not “peregruzka,’ which means ‘overcharged.”
Hmm.
Russia has been pushing the peregruzka button ever since

Don’t forget Obama’s June 2009 speech in Egypt titled “A New Beginning,” which outlined how the US would build stronger ties to the Muslim community through “mutual respect.” Of course, the ultimate success of that policy is contingent upon whether you consider beheadings respectful.
