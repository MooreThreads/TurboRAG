I Am Not Afraid of Electronics 1
STPI – Creative Workshop & Gallery
Playfulness conjoins with an increasing visual resuscitation for I Am Not Afraid of Electronics. What begins in all these works as an almost naïve challenge, over time develops a different character. While Zul’s playful works initially remind viewers of tic-tac-toe, over time, as we start to notice the embossed impression of electronic circuitry as if hiding from plain view and thus begs for our more precise attention, one is drawn into questions on the elusive nature of infrastructure. With this newfound perspective, the title thus takes on a more resonating meaning, that of a firm declaration against the covert systems which remain quite unknowable to us.
Also the most brilliantly-coloured out of all his STPI’s works, the bold primary colours are a mirror of the basic electronic circuitry that produces pure sinewave. This thus adds another visual layer in how we can enter the sound-focused artistic enquiry of Zul Mahmod.print; emboss on paper 9-part installation
