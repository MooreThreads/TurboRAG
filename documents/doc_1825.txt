This was just the perfect find to finish the bathroom /WC makeover.
Mini Chandelier is the perfect size, just it plug in and hang it up. I did purchase a stronger hook for our drywall. Very pretty.

I bought this in store for my wedding in May to use as the focal point of our arbor we will be married under. And I must just say wow! I love love love it! I purchased if in black. Picture listed online doesn't do justice. Order this you won't regret:
