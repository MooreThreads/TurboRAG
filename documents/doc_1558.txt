- lifeapplicationloverTennesseeAge: 18-24Gender: female3 Stars Out Of 5Beware of purchasing misimprints...February 20, 2014lifeapplicationloverTennesseeAge: 18-24Gender: femaleQuality: 4Value: 4Meets Expectations: 2I purchased the MISIMPRINTED version of this one. I absolutely LOVE everything about it except the misimprint. When you view a sample of misimprinted Bibles they look really good (just a strip of color over the wrong name). I thought I could live with that. It would just add a little something to it, no big deal. When I received the Bible I was highly disappointed in the job they done. It looks like they half way stamped it out but it was not straight. Then they done an additional straight line of brown which doesn't look too bad. So my advice is just know what you're getting into when you order a misimprint. A Bible cover will be an easy fix but don't expect it to look like the examples from this site. I'm sure some look better than what I received but just take note that there is a chance of it not looking near as good as the examples they show.
Besides the horrible cover up on the front, I absolutely LOVE this Bible :)
