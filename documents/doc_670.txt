Replacing your windows is a home improvement that provides a vast array of benefits to a property. Windows are a defining feature of
a home, allowing natural light into your rooms, letting fresh air come in and adding character on the outside. They are also a vital part of keeping your home energy efficient. The truth is that windows have a lifespan, and once they begin to come to the end of their lifespan they can begin to allow water to leak into a property, draughts and condensation that can cause damp and mould.
If your windows are showing signs that they may no longer be functioning as they should, the chances are that they are having an impact on your energy bills too. Don’t let the problem continue to worsen; failing windows require immediate attention. We offer window replacement in Petts Wood, St Mary Cray, BR5 and the surrounding areas, installing brand new, high-performing windows for affordable prices.
Many homes in the UK still have old windows that were installed over 20 years ago. Such windows could be causing a range of problems on your property and may discourage potential buyers from having an interest when it’s time to sell. Whether you are interested in updating your property with single, double or triple glazing, the windows we install offer a plethora of benefits to improve your household.
Reduce your energy bills:
As suppliers continue to raise their energy prices, it has never been more important to take measures to improve your homes energy efficiency. Window replacement should be one of the first ports of call to reduce your energy costs, as a high quality window frame will prevent heat from exiting your property. This also means that investing in window replacement could pay itself back in energy savings in the long run.
Added security:
Burglars and opportunists continue to look for properties with old, single glazed windows to target, as they are far easier to penetrate than newer models, and double or triple glazed windows. New windows may also have a positive effect on your home insurance costs too.
Noise insulation:
Old windows offer very little noise insulation to your property, allowing the sounds of traffic and passers-by to disrupt the peace and quiet inside your home. Double and triple-glazed windows work to muffle the sounds from outside, providing a more relaxing environment inside.
Increased value:
The majority of buyers are aware of the benefits of newer windows, and they will be less likely to buy a property that will lead them to pay over the odds for their energy after moving in. Having your windows replaced can give your home a higher resale value and help it attract more buyers.
If you are unsure whether your windows need to be replaced, there are a number of tell-tale signs that your windows are failing.
They are visibly damaged:
It is normal for windows to show signs of wear and tear over time, however, if your window frames are cracked or rotting, this could be a sign that they are letting mould and damp into your home. This can also be a significant problem when it comes to selling, as cracked and mouldy frames will look unsightly to buyers.
Condensation:
This is a common problem for older windows, and it suggests that your windows are no longer ventilating as they should. Installing new
windows with high-quality panes that allow air in and out, as usual, should solve the problem of condensation.
They are letting in draughts:
This is one of the biggest signs that your windows need to be replaced, as it can be seriously impacting your central heating system. This usually means that the seal around the window is failing due to age, a problem easily solved by window replacement.
