A programme of additional activities to improve your grades, skills and future progression.
We want your time at College to be successful, enjoyable and rewarding. Our priority is for you to leave us with excellent grades and reach your academic potential, but we also encourage skills and experience that will prepare you for a successful future.
How does JCC Extra work?
We expect all students to commit to at least 35 hours a year of ‘JCC Extra’ and this forms part of your study programme at College. At the beginning of each year, and again in January, you will choose one or more activities that you think help you achieve at least one of the following:
- Help you develop new and important skills
- Stretch and challenge you academically
- Support your studies and improve your grades
- Build up an effective experience portfolio
- Enhance your UCAS personal statement
- Spark a new interest
- Meet new people, try new things and have fun!
Attendance.
Activities will take place at different times throughout the week. Some activities will last for a number of weeks, others may be a one day-event and sessions will take place at different times throughout the week. You must check when your session takes place because, once you have registered for an activity, you will be expected to attend for the duration of the programme and your attendance will be recorded.
As well as academic excellence, the College will recognise students who contribute above and beyond expected standards. This will be part of our annual Beacon Awards.
Your Skills Audit.
Your Personal Progress Tutor will work with you to keep a Skills Audit in which you will identify the skills and measure how far they have developed at different points in the year. This will begin in October and will be repeated in March and June. Your Progress Tutor and teachers will support you in selecting appropriate enrichment.
Some activities will last for a number of weeks, while others may be one-day events. Once you have registered for an activity, you must attend for the duration of your programme, and your attendance will be recorded. Your Personal Progress Tutor will help you to keep a ‘skills journal’, in which you will record the activities you are taking part in, and reflect upon them. Your journal will be used to evaluate the personal, academic and social skills you are developing.
For participating in JCC Extra activities, you will receive the following certificates:
• JCC Extra Bronze Award – 35 hours
• JCC Extra Silver Award – 70 hours
• JCC Extra Gold Award – 100 hours
