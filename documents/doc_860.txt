Movie Night: Movie 43
This film will leave you with your mouth wide-open. A couple of teenagers (who I will name Dumb and Dumber), upload a silly home video on ‘Youtube’ and surprisingly get a few hundred thousand hits within the first few minutes.
Enter the genius computer guru of a little brother to Dumb, who tells them it’s a hoax. They (Dumb and Dumber), in a quest to get back at little brother, start telling the porkies about the existence of the mythical Movie 43, which will and I quote ‘make you crap your pants’ amongst other things. Amidst the story telling the duo download viruses from porn sites onto little brother’s computer whilst he assists them in the search for Movie 43.
And so begins the adventure where we, the rebellious audience, watch a series of short stories spewed out by a search engine which are meant to bring us closer to completing the quest for the mind-bending Movie 43. Noteworthy moments include testicles on a chin, guacamole stirred by Halle Berry’s boob and a homosexual animated cat who spews his load all over his owner’s new girlfriend.
If none of the above intrigue you, Stifler (Seann William Scott) meets a fairy that will suck dick for gold coins! Please watch it, so we can discuss some of the best quotes ever in a movie. You will never think about the late night grocery shopping the same way again.
Starring Emma Stone, Halle Berry, Kate Winslet, Hugh Jackman, Stephen Merchant, Seann William Scott, Jason Sudekis and many many more.
Rating: 8.5/10
