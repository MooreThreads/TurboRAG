A capacity crowd had already taken their seats inside the Ninth Street school's gymnasium, where top-ranked St. Anthony would put its 82-game winning streak on the line against New Jersey's No. 3 ranked team, East Brunswick.
Senior guard Hallice Cooke treated those who arrived early enough to score seats -- or standing room -- with a brilliant 3-point shooting performance in St. Anthony's 46-37 victory. The Oregon State recruit scored a game-high 18 points on six 3-pointers, as St. Anthony (18-0) capped a grueling five-day stretch by running its win streak to 83 consecutive games.
Ranked No. 4 in USA Today, the Friars now turn their attention to a looming encounter with St. Benedict's Prep (19-0), No. 5 in USA Today, at the Prudential Center on Friday. Tip-off is set for 8:15 p.m.
But before that could happen, Cooke took aim at East Brunswick's 1-3-1 zone defense. The Bears (15-1), who entered the game with two marquee victories this season against state-ranked No. 7 St. Joseph (Metuchen), used the 1-3-1 alignment early last night. That served as Cooke's green light from the outside.
"We prepared for 1-3-1 first and then man (defense). The way it was going to go early here, this is Hallice Cooke night against the zone at home," said St. Anthony coach Bob Hurley. "People were expecting to see him take a lot of deep shots against the zone and really make the zone run a lot of guys at him. And we saw it."
Cooke sparked St. Anthony's most productive offensive stretch with four 3-pointers in the second quarter alone. After East Brunswick's Jake Krantz hit a 19-foot jump shot to tie the game at 9-9 in the final seconds of the first quarter, Cooke helped his team outscore the Middlesex County squad 17-6 in the second frame with three-straight trifectas over a 1:20 span.
"It attracts a lot of attention, which opens up my teammates," Cooke said of his 3-point exploits. "After I hit the first one and got my confidence going, the basket felt like the ocean."
The home team's lead ballooned to 14 points with 4:49 to play in the fourth quarter when Cooke drilled his final 3-pointer of the game. But showing poise, East Brunswick scrapped back to within nine points (44-35) in the last minute of play on a 3-pointer from NJIT-bound Rob Ukawuba, who was limited to just five points.
From there, Josh Brown (nine points) and Kentrell Brooks (six points) sunk one free throw each to put the finishing touches on the Friars' fourth victory in five days. St. Anthony, which is holding opponents to just 34.3 points a game this season, won the SNY Invitational over the weekend, followed by a Monday night tilt against Newark Tech.
"Traditionally, two days before a game you go hard (in practice) and then light the day before. Tomorrow, we're going to come in and practice for one hour. No disrespect to St. Benedict's, we should not do it for more than an hour," said Hurley.
"The coaches are tired, the managers are tired, Mrs. Hurley is tired, the bus driver's tired, we're all tired.
"We weren't going to allow (fatigue) to be (an excuse)," Hurley added. "Was it in there? Obviously, but if we lost this game it was because they played better today."
But for the 83rd game in a row, Hurley and the Friars didn't have to ponder such thoughts.
