Space Maze 3D
Rated 3 / 5 stars
It reminds me of the maze screensaver that used to come with Windows lol. I did not find the end, so I cannot comment on whatever reward there may or may not be at the end of the maze. To tell you the truth, first person view drives me nuts, but that isn't reflected in my rating. Maybe if there were some variances in the design of the walls, it might have kept my attention. Some eerie music in the background would have been nice; Distressing count-down-type music would have added to the urgency and the desire to find the exit.
Kept me playing for almost 10 stages. Would have played longer, but I'm too lazy to sit and solve level 10. It's a really interesting game, and I will come back to it later :)
That Falling Music Game.

This movie reminds me of the creepy dreams that I would have as a child. Very, very unsettling...

I have never seen anything like this before! Very unique. :)
Thanks a lot!

It's a nice fluid animation, but the title got my hopes up for a short, not a loop.
