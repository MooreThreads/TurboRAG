Even thought the world didn’t end this year, 2012 is about to finish, and it’s the time for another insightful end-of-the-year blog post, where I take the time to review the best of my blog, my accomplishments of the year, and more importantly, it’s when I start to think about the path I’m laying down for the upcoming year.
The best of 2012 was certainly the post about a rather funny Starbucks logo that went viral over StumbleUpon just a couple of hours after being published and brought more than 20,000 visits alone. That was really surprising! On the other hand, a post that has been consistently popular throughout the year is the one with logos from the Olympic Games, but considering the London 2012 Olympic games, that turned out to be a pretty obvious result.
Surely this year was not limited just by the two articles I mentioned above. Many other posts were very popular, here’s a list of what people most read on my blogs during 2012:
- Modern Vintage Logo Design Inspiration
- Evolution of the Batman Logo by Rodrigo Rojas
- Microsoft Windows 8 New Logo Design
- Free Logo Vectors from Women Magazines
- Doctor Who Logo History
- 10 Fantastic Fonts for Bold Memorable Logos
- 5-year-old Analyses Logos
- The Logo that Should Have Been Stumbled Upon
- How to Organise Your Design Project Folders
It has been a great blogging year, not only because of the sheer amount of visitors I welcomed in my blogs, but also because writing so much is proving to be the best exercise to better my understanding of English grammar. I cannot avoid rolling my eyes whenever I read my old posts, and I’m sure you would too, but the dichotomy between my current and past writing also serves to show that all one needs to write well is to write a lot.
I’m sure I still make a lot of silly mistakes, but I feel much more comfortable with a keyboard than last year. So, following a yearly tradition of classifying my own writing skills, I think this year I’m going with bread-and-butter. Not much, but a big improvement from last year’s outrageously-bad. Woohoo! Way to go me! :)
Actually, this is the first year that I’ve felt confident enough to not use a very demeaning adjective in my classification system. I’m sure I must thank WoordUp for that, a variety blog where I write daily about anything that get my attention during the day. I wrote 647 articles there this year, that’s a lot of practice! If you want to learn how to write, the best advice I can give is to start a daily blog! Practice my friend, as if there is no tomorrow!
With all of that said, the icing on the blogging cake this year was being invited to write for WebDesigner Depot, a blog that I’ve been reading long before I’ve started to think about writing my own. I felt truly honored and it has been a pleasure to reach out to so many of you, who started to read my blog after finding my posts there. If you haven’t read those yet, I must ask you to check this page, it contains links to the posts I wrote for them.
I guess that’s it. Oh no, wait, I almost forget to talk about Logoness
First and foremost, Logoness is a vector logo library I started earlier this year. I’ve been personally checking the quality of hundreds of vectorized logos and uploading them one by one to build the best high-quality logo library of the web. If you ever need a vector logo, feel free to use Logoness, and please let me know what you think of it. I would love your feedback.
But that’s not all, I’ve moved all of my logo related posts there, and I must admit that I’m not sure where that blog is going yet, but the truth is that I would love to find a few collaborators to write about logo design there in the upcoming year. So, just in case, if you are reading this, and would like to get your name out there writing for a new super-duper logo blog, please, by all means, get in touch. If you think your English is not good enough, don’t worry, everyone needs to start somewhere, perhaps I can help you with that.
Well, that’s all folks. Thanks for reading and Happy New Year! :)
