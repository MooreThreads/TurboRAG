 2. /TASS/. Unidentified armed robbers attempted to hijack and rob a Russian mail delivery van in the Trans-Baikal Territory, however, the postmen managed to defend themselves and ward off the attackers, the press service of the federal postal operator told TASS on Friday.
"One of the masked attackers fired several shots, allegedly from a carbine rifle, at a vehicle that was proceeding along the Mogocha - Tupik roadway, puncturing the vehicle’s front and rear right tires. The 54-year-old driver of the postal vehicle remained calm, and sped up, trying to escape from the attackers," the press service stated. "However, the damaged vehicle failed to pick up or maintain speed, so the driver and another postal employee, having lost the pursuers, abandoned the car and vanished into the woods."
The press service noted that both the mailman and driver were carrying a special fire-proof bag containing money intended for social entitlement payments to the region’s residents - a total of some 2 million rubles ($30,390).
"Using a mobile phone, the postal workers reported the incident to the police and later when operatives arrived at the scene, they came out of the taiga on to the road," the source reported.
According to the source, the mailmen were not hurt in the ambush and managed to safeguard the money.
"The Trans-Baikal branch of Russia’s postal service is providing all necessary assistance to law enforcement agencies in order to solve the crime and apprehend the perpetrators," the press service reported.
