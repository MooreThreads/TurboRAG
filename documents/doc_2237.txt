Our beloved Caesar is in need of a caregiver (Foster Home). He is a pure-bred German Shepard ( 3 years old, neutered, vaccinated and documented ). He is friendly to people, cats and other dogs. Caesar is also good tempered and obedient. My family and I are moving from Doha Qatar to Jubail KSA, but Caesar cannot live with us in the Bechtel compound. We are looking for a caregiver in the Jubail/Kobar vicinity who will look after him. My family will be fully responsible for Caesar financially and for keeping his health and legal records up to date. We will also pay a monthly fee to the caregiver and visit with Caesar often. At the end of my contract, we will take him back with us to the USA. If you can Foster Caesar or want more information about him, please contact Paul K. Leemon, directly by telephone at: 059.829.9759 or by email at [email protected] If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me. --- American Citizen Services Consulate General of the United States | Dhahran, Saudi Arabia U.S. Department of State | +966.013.330.3200 | [email protected] Register at
