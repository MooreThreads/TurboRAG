Autism and the coronavirus
Parents with a child or children with a disability are facing a challenging moment in regards to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. School closings, social distancing, businesses shutting down, sporting events and leagues on hiatus, along with health professionals saying enough isn’t being done just adds to the daily growing concerns for a family with a special needs child. As a parent with a child on the autism spectrum this is by far one of the most concerning times as a family with a child that’s non-verbal.
They can’t express if they’re not feeling well so constant monitoring of their temperature is imperative especially if appear to be not feeling well. They’re daily routine is disrupted leading to confusion and anxiety so engagement in creative activities like art, music even gardening is helpful with perpetuating academic and social development. Our son, Noah who deals with allergies, especially this time of year, has us on edge with every sneeze and sniffle and brings a constant concern with explaining to people in stores that everything is ok, he’s autistic, non-verbal and has allergies. How long will this last, how long will schools be shut down, businesses close and social distancing a daily practice? No one can say with certainty. So, parents with a special needs child or children stay woke, aware and continue to love unconditionally.
