Winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, Robert Frost was born on 26th March and I just missed on to mention here. You can find the profile of Robert Frost on Literature pages here.
Well, the American Editors rejected the Poetry of Robert Frost. He attended the Dartmouth and Harvard but never earned a degree.
For I have had too much
Of apple-picking: I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired!
A cheerful and descriptive poetry style of writing yet Robert Frost's poetry reflected dark side of life and thoughtful musings on life. As clear from his one poem "Apple Picking", Robert Frost considers how life has been experienced fully but with regrets and mistakes. While picking apples, the poet feels exhausted and here's as you read, it reminds of the school days as you jot down the Central Idea of the poem. Written with unrhymed iambic pentameter again, blank verse - some lines in soothing rhythm and some stop short.
Ask a student who appears for the schools exams and there's a confusion between a Central Idea and a Character Sketch. No, really I mean it as it so happens, the children are over-burden with the examination pressure and they end up confused when actually they have to write the Central Idea, they end up writing Character sketch while doing revisions. Understanding the Questions is too important to reply - Answers come with clarity of Understanding.
First week of April are examinations days and here's examination tips for all school going students.
