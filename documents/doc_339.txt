Now.
This is a nice windfall for the state but it isn't the boon it looks like at first glance. In fact, it highlights a serious problem with the state's budgeting process: it's completely at the mercy of the earnings of the rich.
I wrote about this back in January:.
Actually,. [OR by selling Facebook stock!] This means that they're disproportionately exposed to market volatility. And the markets have been plenty volatile over the past couple of years.
Look, we're lucky to have Facebooks and Googles and Apples in the California economy. But their presence — and the activities of shareholders who pay taxes in the state — isn't going to solve the extremely pressing problems of a budget that's carrying a structural deficit of around $5 billion and that's facing unemployment that could climb above 11 percent again over the next few months (and that's unlikely to fall into the single-digits for years).
So welcome the Facebook effect. Just don't depend on it.
