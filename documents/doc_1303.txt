 Kirsten Gillibrand continues her New York City tour with constituents as she visits a group of Hispanic clergy Saturday in the Bronx. WNYC's Elaine Rivera reports.
REPORTER: Gillibrand will be one of several elected officials to address the Hispanic Clergy Organization at their banquet in the Bronxdale section of the Bronx. A spokesman for the new senator says it's part of a number of stops she's been making to understand the issues facing the diverse number of groups in the city. Gillibrand had been the congresswoman from a conservative district in upstate New York. And she was strongly criticized by Latinos and other immigrants groups when she was selected to replace Hillary Clinton in January. Gillibrand had been opposed to amnesty for undocumented immigrants, supported English as the official language and favored building a fence on the Mexican border. She has since softened on some of her positions. Gillibrand will continue touring the city next week, including stops in Brooklyn and Staten Island.
