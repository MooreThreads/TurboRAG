A six-year-old from Rushden has raised more than £700 for Help for Heroes after asking for charity donations rather than presents at his birthday party.
Higham Ferrers Infants School pupil Archie Rankin got friends to dress up as soldiers and smashed his original target of £50.
His dad Glenn used to be a tank transporter in the Army and served in Bosnia and Kosovo.
Archie has raised more than £500 online, with further donations in cash.
And mum Petrina says she is very emotional at how her son has been selfless and raised money for something he is passionate about.
She said: “I burst into tears with pride at how much Archie has raised and how he hasn’t thought of himself.
“Most six-year-olds are desperate for as many presents as they can get but he hasn’t even thought about that.
“I can’t believe how much he has raised considering our original target, it’s amazing.
“All of the other parents thought it was so lovely as well and think Archie has been brilliant.
“We’ve now been visited by the county organisers for Help for Heroes and Archie has been asked to be a volunteer at other events.
“We’re keeping the fundraising open and we just want to keep going with it.”
