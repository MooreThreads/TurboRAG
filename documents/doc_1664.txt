Okay, so we may never have the reported $2 million worth of Hermés handbags owned by Victoria Beckham...but thanks to a once-in-a-lifetime sale just a few days away, we may be able to score one luxury satchel at a sorta-affordable price...
The eBay Fashion Vault is holding an Hermés sale in just six days, and there are 25 hot handbags up for grabs--and some still clock in at less-than-a-few-months'-rent prices. The fabulous calf-leather hobo bag above was just $202.50 at publishing time, while a black leather portfolio clutch's highest bid was $177.50.
Of course, there are some seriously spendy items in the mix, too: This ostrich Kelly bag already has a high bid of $2,025, and we're guessing the lone Birkin will fetch a pretty penny, as well. But for now, there are still some serious deals to be scored, so head over to eBay and fulfill your handbag fantasies!
