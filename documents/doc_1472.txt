Nobody loves Edelweiss more than me. Nobody. But when it comes right down to the nitty gritty, if you're sworn to tell the truth, the complete truth and nothing but the truth... I'd say that the "real flower" of Austria is the actually the hanging geranium.
I would wager nearly 75-80% of all balcony window boxes contain them so I figured they needed a little attention.
Was kind of bummed that my Edding Marker exploded while journaling. You see a major smear starting between the words "think" and "about" and then it carries down to "but" and "people."
I think they just got too hot in the car or something. They all seemed to give me trouble. They smeared all over the pages and sadly also had major leak-through to the backsides.
Note to self: use better paper.
I wouldn't worry about exploding markers, some of the best art is produced when an accident happens. I recently did a painting that really didn't look that great at all and I was trying to talk my cat into walking all over it so that at least some interesting random shapes would be introduced on it, but she wasn't interested. Shame really, I just know the painting would have improved greatly. I might try going over it with a leaking marker pen and just see what happens.

Geraniums are really beautiful and you did a nice job capturing that in your journal, and your lettering... wow! You sure know how to fill a page with yummy letters!
