The look of this dish, black and white, gives no clues concerning its flavour. The subtle aniseed and nutty notes of the soup, and unexpected sweetness of the black garlic crumbs, are sure to elicit some interesting responses from your fellow diners.
The cannellini beans are the foundation, in terms of texture and taste, for the sweet aniseed of the roasted fennel and the nutty roasted cauliflower. It is a subtle yet hearty soup, equally at home on a cold winters night, or at a summer lunch.
While the soup is delicious on its own, the black garlic crumble makes it unforgettable. A perfect counterpoint visually, as well as in terms of taste and texture. If you don’t like garlic, don’t let that put you off using black garlic. Changing raw garlic into black garlic is a truly transformational process – black garlic tastes quite different to the raw garlic it used to be, yet is as good for you as it ever was.
Beans are widely available in cans. While very convenient, they are different from cooked fresh or dried beans. Have you ever compared the taste of canned peas to frozen or fresh peas? Almost a different vegetable. Serious Eats has a great post on all aspects of beans – soaking times, fresh versus canned, and the characteristics of different types of beans.
One of the advantages of using dried beans is the opportunity to use aromatics (onion, garlic, and herbs) when cooking them. This will transform the beans into something much more flavorful, especially compared to what you get from a can.
