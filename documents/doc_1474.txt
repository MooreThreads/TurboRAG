A HISTORY OF GROWTH AND STABILITY
Old Republic International
Corporation.
Old Republic manages its business
through more than 125 corporate entities, of which 23
are insurance subsidiaries covering all 50 states and
Canada. Old Republic's companies market, underwrite, and
provide risk management services for a multitude of
coverages, predominantly in the general (property and
liability), mortgage guaranty, and title insurance
arenas. A small life and health insurance business is
also conducted in the U.S. and Canada, principally as an
adjunct to the Company's general insurance operations.
The breadth of coverages ensures wide diversification
and dispersion of risks. Additionally, Old Republic's
companies focus only on carefully selected major sectors
of the American economy that are not uniformly exposed
to the same business cycles. The Company operates in a
decentralized manner that emphasizes specialization by
type of insurance coverage, as well as industries and
economic sectors served.
Old Republic publishes an
Annual Review that is widely distributed to agents,
brokers, customers, employees, and others interested in
the Company's business objectives and product offerings.
The most current Annual Review is downloadable in the
Investors section of this Website.
