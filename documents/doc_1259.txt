PNC Bank
Where do you see yourself in 10 years? I see myself as leading the Florida Treasury Management team at PNC as an established brand leader in all major Florida markets. I will be looking for new ways to challenge myself through leadership roles in community and civic organizations.
What’s the best part of your day? Coming home to my children’s smiling faces after a great day at work.
Diaz’s 12-year banking career in Tampa Bay has been with three financial institutions: SunTrust, BankAtlantic and finally PNC. In August, she was promoted to lead the entire Florida Corporate Treasury Management sales team, from Miami to Tallahassee.
Diaz supports a number of charities but Junior Achievement is the organization she supports most. “I had great mentors in my life and I am now passing it on to the next generation,” she said in submission materials.
