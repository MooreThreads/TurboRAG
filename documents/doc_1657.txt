Macintosh users who want to buy a Windows Phone 7 will soon have the option to do so.
“Later in 2010, Microsoft will make a public beta available of a tool that allows Windows Phone 7 to sync select content with Mac computers,” a Microsoft spokesperson said.
But what is unclear is whether the software will be a version of the Zune desktop software, which Windows users will use to sync their computers and Windows Phone 7 devices, or some other tool.
The company confirmed the Macintosh plans Tuesday after a U.K. employee tweeted about Mac syncing — then quickly deleted the Twitter post.
After Microsoft announced Windows Phone 7′s Nov. 8 availability on AT&T in the U.S. — and the dozens of other simultaneous announcements — there was one glaring hole: Microsoft still had not said whether Mac users would be able to get the necessary Zune software for Windows Phone 7. People assumed this meant no, especially after Microsoft said it had released a new version of the Zune software.
But some sort of Mac support is on the way.
