Approved in June 2020, the National Digital Transformation Program targets to turn Vietnam into a country that can compete with developed countries in digital technology. This sets the ground for Vienam to actively capitalise on the opportunities brought on by today's technological revolution.
According to experts, Vietnam has implemented great foundations for digital enterprises to thrive. Technology has been the key factor leading to the explosion of innovative startups in IT.
At this year's Top 10 Vietnam ICT Companies 2021 event, Deputy Minister of Information and Communications Pham Duc Long said that technology companies have greatly contributed to pandemic prevention by building and deploying digital platforms and solutions; ensuring seamless communications; helping businesses maintain efficient operations; and enabling people to work and study remotely.
The pandemic has inspired domestic technology enterprises to not only ride the “digital” wave but also to help Vietnam solidify its position in the global technology landscape.
One Mount, with its comprehensive technology capabilities, has been named at the event as a great example of the new breed of companies providing a suite of technological solutions and offerings for businesses and consumers across multiple life stages.
Creating a comprehensive technology ecosystem
Having launched in the fall of 2019, One Mount has had to navigate through a global pandemic in its first two years of operation. This has brought it both challenges and opportunities as it sought to affirm the value of its technology business, which has contributed to the country's technology and economic goals even during this challenging period. Just after two years, One Mount has pioneered the deployment of technology solutions that help businesses digitalise their operations and solve bottlenecks in many traditional sectors.
Leveraging its multi-faceted and modern technology offerings, One Mount is focused on optimising benefits for value chains across a spectrum of industries and audiences including small- and medium-sized enterprises, end-consumers across distribution, as well as retail and real estate, to name a few.
In the distribution sector, VinShop has established itself as one of the country's largest consumer goods distributors which have helped to digitalise more than 80,000 small groceries. Taking advantage of technological advancements to provide maximum support for users, One Mount has helped to connect businesses, manufacturers, and consumers within its ecosystem, allowing goods to reach customers quickly while ensuring stable prices. In addition to helping improve the income of thousands of small groceries, VinShop also helps to ensure the supply of essential goods while helping consumers feel confident about the quality of the products they buy.
At the intersection between technology and humanity, where every individual in the ecosystem benefits and develops, One Mount has developed a lifestyle super app with VinID, one of the top loyalty platforms in Vietnam serving millions of users on a monthly basis. VinID recently has refined its point tiering system and is rolling out a more dedicated personalisation engine bringing users a more curated experience for their favourite products and brands.
Meanwhile, OneHousing and OneHousing Pro Agent has established itself as the No.1 distributor and supplier of Masterise Homes projects in Hanoi. In addition to the premium services, the myHome application integrated with VinID has attracted tens of thousands of homeowners and households during its beta launch. With more products and premium services on the horizon, OneHousing is expected to transform the real estate landscape in Vietnam by providing a complete one-stop-shop experience for home buying, selling, and living.
To realise this early success and fulfil its grand vision, One Mount has formed landmark strategic partnerships with reputable industry-leading companies such as in its Top 10 Vietnam ICT Companies 2021. One Mount nabbed a spot in three different categories: Top 10 Companies Providing Digital Transformation Platforms, Top 10 Fintech Companies, and Top 10 Logistics and E-Commerce Companies. Apart from this, One Mount was selected by HR Asia Magazine as one of the Best Companies to Work for in Asia 2021 in recognition of its outstanding HR practices, attractive benefits, policies, and engaging work environment.
One Mount garnered two prestigious awards just as it celebrates two years of remarkable growth. This has further strengthened its commitment to empowering Vietnamese businesses to become digital-first and consumer-first companies.
One Mount remains committed to growing together with Vietnam, improving the efficiency of its economy through the company's digital ecosystem and helping the country resume its upward trajectory and become a regional technology leader.
