It’s the middle of August and the heat of the summer is making me wish for the crisp air of the Fall season to hurry up and make its place here in Texas. Football preseason has started, I’ve noticed my local grocer pulling out the Halloween décor and pumpkins- ahhh pumpkins.. makes me really crave a good bowl of chili or a deep plate of pasta to warm my belly. The idea is good in theory, but not so much when the temperature gauge reads 101.
Doesn’t mean I can’t have some pasta, though! Try this light summer pasta for dinner this week.. I bet you have all the ingredients on hand already. Mix and match the veggies and protein to you and your family’s taste. We made this with shrimp, spinach, bell pepper, and feta cheese. The options are endless!
Ingredients
- 2 (6 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breast
- 1 pound asparagus spears, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 medium yellow onion, quartered
- 1 pint cherry tomatoes, sliced in half lengthwise
- 8 ounces whole button mushrooms, quartered
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- 3 tablespoons plus ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
- ½ teaspoon cracked black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ cup shaved parmesan
- 1 pound cooked spiral shaped pasta
Instructions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a large bowl, combine chopped veggies, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning with 3 tablespoons olive oil, tossing to coat. Arrange in an even layer on a large foil lined baking sheet. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until tomatoes burst and garlic and onion are golden.
While the veggies roast, grill the chicken. Season trimmed chicken breasts with salt and pepper- over both sides. Arrange chicken on a grill rack coated with cooking spray; grill 5-7 minutes. Turn chicken over; grill 5-7 minutes or until done and juices run clear. Remove from the grill and allow chicken to rest for 5-10 minutes.
Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. In a large mixing bowl combine roasted veggies and their juices, cooked pasta, ¼ cup olive oil, and parmesan cheese. Toss to coat evenly. Add salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot!
