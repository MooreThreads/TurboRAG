Podding across Europe!
Posted on
Jayne & Godfrey Wilkinson collected their Go-Pod from Red Lion on the 2nd August 2019 - and then set straight off on an epic road trip across Europe! This is what they said;
We picked up our new Go-Pod on 2nd August 2019.
We then travelled for a month across Europe, staying in the Go-Pod on a number of campsites in France, Switzerland and Italy, to our final destination on 31st August, the Mani, in the Peloponnese, Greece.
We travelled a total of 3158 km (1963 miles), it was a great trip and the perfect way to travel.

The Go-Pod's ease of use and manouevrability make it an excellent choice for road trips abroad.
Have a look at some of their pictures from the trip below!
