1996 Volvo 850 GLT 2.4 from North America
Summary:
Second Volvo to save my life.
Faults:
Oxygen sensor failure.
Stereo kept shorting out.
General Comments:
This was my second Volvo, the first having been destroyed by a tractor trailer.
This car was a great car, I didn't enjoy it as much as my previous 740 in part beacuse of the automatic transmission.
It felt slightly detached in comparison to the 740.
The 850 was a comfortable car to drive, very luxurious, interior very spacious.
Once again Volvo engineering saved my life, I tried to dodge a deer and spun the car and went backwards into a telephone pole at about 40 mph destroying the back of the car, I managed to stumble away from the wreck after kicking the door open (heavy frame damage) but all in all I was fine.
After my experiences my children will drive Volvo's.
Would you buy another car from this manufacturer? Yes

Volvo has always been a leading innovator in automotive safety. As a technician I have heard countless stories from customers who walked away from fatality car crashes or loved ones whose lives were saved. My sister recently received a 2005 S-40 company car and was broadsided in the driver door at 40mph. The side curtain and airbag saved her pretty face and vital organs from a BIG CHEVY. After she walked away and was given a large SUV rental car she was impressed that her compact car took such a shot. She complained a little about bruising from the pyrotechnic seat belt and airbags, but appreciated what could have been. The car was not totaled due to its boron steel reinforcement and now sports two new left door skins and substructure. Oh well its only a company car. Just so you know I care please don't make left turns from the center lane.
