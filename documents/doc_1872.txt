Maxi Cosi colour 2021
Always have your own bed with you- who doesn´t want that? The Maxi Cosi travel cot Iris, at least allows your little darling to dream of having the own bed when travelling. In the cosy bed, your sweetheart will have guaranteed a good sleep on your travels. It doesn´t matter whether you are travelling with your newborn baby or with your older darling, the mattress of the travel cot can be flexibly adjusted between two levels. In the high level, you can put your newborn to sleep without to having to bend down deeply. If your darling is a little bigger, you can simply lower the mattress one level. The high outer walls with their large mesh windows not only prevent your child from climbing out of the bed, they also ensure good ventilation and give you a clear view of your sleeping sweetheart. The included cosy mattress lets your darling relax like sleeping on a cloud.
Particularly practical: you can easily fold up the Iris travel cot in just a few minutes and store it in the portable travel bag. Thanks to its light weight, the Maxi Cosi travel cot is particularly easy to carry and give you a high degree of mobility. In addition, the cloth elements are easy to remove and washable.
The Maxi Cosi travel cot Iris is also perfect as a second bed. The simple, beautiful colours and the high-quality workmanship make the Maxi Cosi travel cot Iris to a special eye-catcher.
