- A special event will occur if you have all four of the following Pokemon in your party: Keldeo, Cobalion, Virizion and Terrakion. This will cause the event-only Pokemon Keldeo to learn Secret Sword .
Guide
Start by heading left, where you’ll come across a clearing. If you bring the legendary Pokemon Cobalion, Virizion, Terrakion and Keldeo here, Keldeo will learn Secret Sword and transform into its Resolute Forme . The former three can be caught in this game, but Keldeo can only be obtained via a special event.
To the east of the clearing is a boulder that you can push with Strength. Past here is a deep pool, some items and a Parasol Lady standing in a very awkward position. If it’s Winter, you can’t even stop in front of her to begin a battle!
Nope, there is no way to slide to the Parasol Lady… How’d she even get there?!
Trainer Battle: Parasol Lady
With this little corner fully explored, return to the clearing and slowly make your way clockwise around the moor. Towards the north you can exchange fistcuffs with a male Pokemon Ranger.
Trainer Battle: Pokemon Ranger
Then when you’re ready, leap down the ledge to his south and check out the remaining part of the moor. Around here, you can face two trainers.
Trainer Battle: Fisherman
Trainer Battle: Pokemon Ranger
…And that’s about it for this area. Kind of underwhelming really, but still a lot of fun, especially if it’s slippery Winter. Now have your avian friend use Fly to return to Icirrus City or whichever town you want to go to.
