Customer Reviews
Good show
Fine outlet to showcase talents from the independent wrestling scene. Audio quality is okay. Banter among the hosts is entertaining, though rambling at times. This revamped version is a "step up" from past episodes.
Great job guys!
Scott & Matt do a tremendous job talking to both the veteran and younger talent that they cross paths with in their travels in Independent wrestling. A very laid back show with just two friends hanging out and discussing what they love. It's very hard to not have a good, postive vibe towards wrestling once they wrap up each show.
Excellent
A weekly take on wrestling from the Indy scene in North Carolina spotlighting the AIWF, which is bringing back territorial wrestling? Count me in. Scott and Matt have a good thing going here, definitely listen in. The possibilities are endless.
