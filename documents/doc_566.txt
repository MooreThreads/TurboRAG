Example text
At this time, he was married to a Miss Cheng. In 1911, the Nationalist Party organized an officers school in Chungqing. Liu enrolled in the school to begin his life as a soldier, his last chance to escape starvation. The school was modeled after the schools in Japan. Many of the instructors were graduates from Japanese schools, and the textbooks that were used were translated from Japanese. In his spare time, Liu read Chinese military books, including the Strategies of Sunzi. In 1912, he graduated in and became an officer.
As the battles were joined, it was apparent that the Nationalist position was hopeless and that its troops were tired of fighting. A large detachment of Nationalist forces surrendered, making a rigorous defense impossible. The forces were crushed except for a detachment that was able to flee to Indochina, south of the border, and eventually join the Nationalist forces in Taiwan. Chiang Kaishek and his leading generals fled to Taiwan. Thus, the major battles in the conflict between the Communists and the Nationalists were over, leaving only pockets in China to be mopped up.
With the food supplies acquired from the peasants, the Communists had a solid hold on the entire countryside of Manchuria. Through airdrops, the Nationalists gained the control of the major cities in Manchuria. The troops coming by sea were delayed. The Russians controlled Port Arthur and Darien and denied the Nationalist troops the right to land there. Finally, the Nationalist troops had to turn south and landed at Qinhuangdao. American military advisers again urged Chiang to pull out of Manchuria, knowing that the odds were against him and that he needed the best regiments for the defense of southern China.
