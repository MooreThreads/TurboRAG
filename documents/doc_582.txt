In honor of this theme song coming back let’s do a quick top 5. Nothing like an awesome theme song to properly set that “big game” mood.
5. NHL on ESPN
I actually forgot how awesome this song is until today’s news. So much intensity behind it. The fact the ESPN completely gave up on the NHL really does suck.
4. NFL on Fox
Gold standard for football themes.
Bonus Fox Injury Music – I’m not joking when I say I want this music to play at my funeral on perpetual loop. I don’t ask for a lot but I’m asking for this.
3. College Basketball
Little more applicable right now but if you played me this music in the middle of August it would get me fired up. Just washes you over with a million tourney moments seared into your brain.
2. Masters
The greatest nap music of all time. You hear this and you know 2 things. 1) Spring is here and 2) You’re going to spend all of Saturday and Sunday in and out of sleep while Jim Nantz softly whispers sweet nothings into your ear. A tradition unlike any other.

1. NBA on NBC
Might be a controversial number 1 selection but this one just holds too much weight. This is Michael Jordan. This is Charles Barkley and Patrick Ewing and Shawn Kemp, Hakeem, David Robinson and Orlando Magic Shaq. This is your childhood if you are between the ages of 22 and 35. Chills on chills.
