IRON MOUNTAIN - A tradition continues Saturday, Aug. 3, with the 36th annual Lake Antoine Classic.
For the last 35 years, LAC proceeds have been donated to Special Olympics. The event includes 15K, 5-mile and 2-mile youth competitive runs along with three non-competitive in a 2-mile fun run/walk, 5-mile Lake Antoine walk and a 15K Lake Fumee bike route.
All events start and finish at Lake Antoine County Park. Race day registration is from 7:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., with all events starting at 9 a.m.
Participants can pre-register until Friday, July 26, at a reduced rate by printing an online form at lakeantoineclassic.com or requesting a form from Katie Maxon at (906) 776-5918 or katie.maxon@dchs.org.
LAC funds support programming for sports like basketball, aquatics, track and field, snow shoeing, cross country skiing and bocce ball. The support enables athletes to travel and participate in competitive events.
"Each year we rely on these funds to maintain our quality programming," said a Special Olympic representative.
For the competitive events, participants are divided into four divisions; male, female, wheelchair or Special Olympian. All pre-registered participants, in every event, receive a short sleeve shirt. Race day registrants receive shirts as long as supplies last.
Registration fees range from $14 to $20 for those who pre-register and $17 to $25 on race day. A $2 discount is given to all UPRR members. All participants age 12 and under pay $5 for any event.
Dickinson County Healthcare System, Econo Foods, Systems Control, Verso Paper and WLUC TV6 are the official sponsors.
