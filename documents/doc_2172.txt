The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) (Cap 88) was first enacted in July 1998 to provide a legal foundation for electronic signatures, and to give predictability and certainty to contracts formed electronically. In July 2010, the ETA was repealed and re-enacted to provide for the continuing security and use of electronic transactions.
