Mr. Hill said the youth has been charged as a juvenile with possession of a handgun and with discharging a firearm.
The accident took place at 8:45 a.m. as the youth was sitting in hishomeroom, a print shop on the first floor of the school in the 2800 block of St. Lo Drive. The gun went off in his pocket, but police could not say whether he had been handling the weapon at the time.
The youngster stumbled into the hallway, where he allegedly handed the gun to Colin Avon Reed, 16, of the 3200 block of Clarion Road, who in turn passed it to Craig Edward Williams, 16, of the 5500 block of Whitwood Road, police said.
From there, the weapon was passed to a 15-year-old who along with Christian Lipscomb, 16, of the 5900 block of Waycross Road took the gun by car to the victim's house in the 5500 block of Cedonia Road, police said.
When police officers went there and explained what had happened, the shooting victim's father found the gun in his 19-year-old son's room and gave it to the officers.
The police said they will consult with the state's attorney's office before considering charges against the victim's brother.
School officials said the victim, a good student, has been suspended and faces expulsion.
