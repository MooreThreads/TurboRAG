RECKLESS LOVE, the flamboyant Finnish rockers who burst spectacularly onto the UK scene in 2010, will have their new / third full studio album released via Spinefarm Records on September 2nd – titled ‘Spirit’, this is the follow-up to 2011’s ‘Animal Attraction’, also issued on the Spinefarm label.
Produced by Ilkka Wirtanen, and with mixing duties divided between Ilkka Wirtanen / Juha Heininen & Petri Majuri, the album represents a bold step forward for RL, with the commercial aspects of the music pushed to new & heady heights, plus the heavier side showing some serious bite, with the wonderfully titled ‘Metal Ass’ hugging the fast lane from first note to last.
Between these two extremes, RL deliver some of their most thoughtful, atmospheric and finely crafted songs to date – the likes of ‘Edge Of Our Dreams’, ‘Dying To Live’, ‘Runaway Love’ & ‘Hot Rain’.
Meanwhile, the second single from the album has now been confirmed as ‘So Happy I Could Die’, with a video due to be filmed in early August; this follows on from lead track / video ‘Night On Fire’…
