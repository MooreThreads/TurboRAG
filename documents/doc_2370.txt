There are two deep purple fruits of fall that I look forward to every year: Conchord grapes and Italian plums. I usually slow roast them in a slow oven of about 275-300 degrees, and then eat them over ricotta or yogurt. The slow roasting concentrates the sugars and makes them delightfully sweet, as well as providing a sauce to serve alongside. This makes a great dessert for a simple dinner, as well as a lovely brunch dish to serve for friends. You can add granola, seeds, nuts, or any herbs and spices to liven it up in your own way.
This season at the shop we are making a Purple Power Smoothie, which combines plums, grapes, tangy goat milk yogurt, and sour cherry juice from Red Jacket Orchards. It is perfectly tangy and sweet, with no other sweetener than the TGM. It comes out a beautiful purple hue, and feels very true to the season. Enjoy this while it lasts, as Conchord grape season is fleeting. And although we are putting away as many as we can, it is moving quickly!
