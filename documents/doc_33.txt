Cheap Alitalia Flights
Alitalia is Italy’s flag carrier, and has its headquarters in Rome. It maintains hubs at both Rome’s Leonardo da Vinci Fiumicino International Airport and Milan’s Malpensa International Airport, the two busiest airpors in the country. Its full name is Alitalia – Linee Aeree Italiane, and the name Alitalia is a play on the Italian word for wings (“ali”) and the name of the country (“Italia”).
Alitalia flies to more than 100 destinations in Africa, Asia, North America, South America and Europe.
The airline has been in financial difficulty for several years (including a period of time when it said it couldn’t pay its workers’ salaries), at one point considering a merger with Air France and KLM (which own 2% of the airline) and more recently getting assistance from the Italian government (which owns 49% of the airline) to help privatize the airline. As of January 2007, Alitalia was looking for a buyer to purchase just over 30% of its shares.
In addition to its financial woes, Alitalia recently had a pretty bad record of losing its passengers’ luggage.
Alitalia is a member of the SkyTeam airline alliance.
