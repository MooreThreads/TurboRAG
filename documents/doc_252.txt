Hello there! Welcome to my travel blog, Nomadilogue, a renewed attempt at documenting and recollecting my backpacking adventures and misadventures on a budget. Yes, I am a self-confessed cheapskate (kuripot) traveler who enjoys the nomadic way of life. I believe that traveling can be enjoyable even with little money in your pocket.
In the coming blog entries, you will read my stories, adventures, mishaps, advice and tips on traveling on the cheap, recommendations on places to visit, where to stay, where to eat, what public transportation to take, et cetera. Everything that you will read here is entirely based on my own first-hand experience, unless otherwise stated. I will also be reposting my old travel-related articles from my now-defunct personal blog which I created way back in 2007. So my posts will not be arranged in chronological order in terms of the travel date, but I will be creating several categories to organize the content.
Although this blog primarily aims to inspire my readers from the Philippines to get out of their comfort zone through traveling, I will try to write stuff that will speak to an international audience. Hopefully, you will find the content posted here helpful in planning your future travels.
I promise myself to update this blog regularly and I plan to keep the promise of being prolific than ever before. Feel free to follow my blog and share your own travel experiences by commenting in my posts.
Thank you for stopping by! Cheers!
