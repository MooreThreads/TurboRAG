Superior, WI (NNCNOW.com) --Forestry officials in Superior are teaming up with the city council to deal with a destructive forest pest, the Emerald Ash Borer.
Douglas County is under a strict quarantine that restricts transportation of ash products to uninfected areas.
City Forester Mary Morgan is suggesting several response scenarios and policy actions to deal with the infestation.
Morgan asked the city council to waive the pesticide ordinance that would allow them to inject unhealthy ash with a pesticide to kill the bug.
Officials also want to provide people with a way to properly dispose of infected trees.
"We also want to establish a marshaling area as a depository for private trees. We have established one ourselves for the boulevard trees but we have a lot of ash in yards that may also fail as well," said Morgan.
She also requested the city approve operationally that all public ash trees will be chipped on site and transported to a marshaling area for disposal by the city.
The city has approximately 3,000 ash trees on public land and about 14,000 on private lands.
No action was taken at the meeting on Tuesday, but the issue will be discussed at the next committee of the whole meeting.
