September 20, 2011-September 21, 2011 – I was watching the season premiere of SNL. It started with an announcement of the cast members, instead of the cold open. This opening montage featured a still photo of each cast member in the middle of the screen against a background of lights that looked like sped-up traffic. Kenan was the first one announced. Then there was a short opening sketch, which was barely an opening sketch. Alec Baldwin, the night’s host, was in the opening. At the end of the opening, nobody said, “Live from New York…” – it instead cut to the montage. Kenan was again the first cast member announced. After the montage, Amy Poehler introduced Maroon 5, who then performed. Amy remained on the main stage during the performance. It turned out that Amy was romantically involved with Adam Levine. This didn’t make sense to me, because, last I heard, she was still married to Will Arnett. I was wondering why Maroon 5 were performing, since Radiohead were the musical guest. Then I saw some indication that Amy wasn’t actually involved with Adam Levine and that she was still married to Will Arnett. But, ultimately it wasn’t clear either way.
