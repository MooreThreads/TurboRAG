Easter!
I always enjoy your posts and photos. The family photo in front of the fireplace is exceptionally nice. Even the cat looks like he's posing.
The cat was so scared of the camera - even before we took the picture. It was Emma's idea to have him in the picture and Paul thought it would be hilarious.
We weren't brave enough for egg dying this year, mostly because I think Luke would have little interest and I'd end up doing all the eggs! Plus I don't eat hard boiled eggs. Next year. And having Luke hunt for eggs was a lot more challenging than I expected! He caught on that they had treats but was more interested in eating the few he did find than actually hunting for the rest. I finally made him find the remaining ones tonight! Looks like you had a great day together! I love Emma being a dinosaur in church. Hahaha.
The worst part about egg dying is having all the hard-boiled eggs leftover. I'm not big on them, but Paul's signature meal is an egg salad sandwich so he'll probably devour most of them. The kids have also suddenly started loving them - I think they just enjoy peeling them (which to me is the WORST part). I actually enjoy the relaxed egg hunts where the kids don't find all the eggs in under three minutes (like Matthew did this year). It's a lot more fun when it lasts a little longer! This time next year, both Luke and Emma will probably be egg hunting pros.
