The University of Lethbridge was established in 1967 as one of Canada's
centennial universities, and grew out of a junior college system originally
operated by Lethbridge Community College. From a student body of approximately
600 that first year, the University has grown to more than 7,000 students
on three campuses
The institution is a primarily undergraduate university with masters
and doctoral degree granting authority in several faculties and schools.
Innovation in teaching, research and technology is among the University's
core business values. An increasing emphasis on research results in approximately
$5 million per year in funding from a variety of provincial and federal
sources.
The University of Lethbridge primarily serves the residents of southern
Alberta, but draws students and employees from several international locations
as well as across Canada. Approximately 70% of the student body comes
from an area outside of Lethbridge. International students come from more
than 37 countries. The University of Lethbridge serves approximately 1,000
Faculty of Management students in the Calgary and Edmonton markets through
campuses in those cities.
