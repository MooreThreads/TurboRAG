I haven't spoken to Kwame since he went off to HBS, but I did get an invitation to his graduation. The hand-written note says,
"Ms. DeLoggio,
Thank you for being you, and believing in me!
I'm here today because of you. You are not forgotten.
Love, Kwame
P. S. I finally did get into Duke JD/MBA in '97. I took great pleasure in turning them down."
What can I say about Kwame that you don't already know? The news has said it all. Here's an example:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 [2005] PRNewswire/ -- U.S. Television star Kwame Jackson -- the first runner-up from the inaugural season of NBC's "The Apprentice" -- will be the distinguished guest speaker Tuesday, Feb. 15th at the prestigious London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) in the United Kingdom.
Jackson is the first African American to be hosted by the LSE Student Union Business Society.... one of reality TV's highest-paid and most sought after speakers. ...

More than 40,000 people visit his website,, monthly. He has appeared in numerous magazines and newspapers including: Fortune, Money, Entrepreneur, Black Enterprise, Vanity Fair, The Washington Post, New York Times and the Wall Street Journal among others. People magazine named him one of America's 50 Most Beautiful People for 2004.
I always told him he'd go far, but even I hadn't imagined the heights he'd reach!
