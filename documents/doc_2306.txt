Onondaga Lake Peace Festival-July 22nd to July 25th
Music, Speakers, Native Art, Story-Telling, More
This year, the Onondaga Lake Peace Festival has been rescheduled to July 22 to July 25. The main entertainment and education events will take place Saturday July 23rd and Sunday July 24th.
The first purpose of the festival is to call people to Onondaga Lake to pray for peace. Organizer David Yarrow said; “We want to resurrect Onondaga Lake as a sacred place where peace was made. We think it’s time to change the public perception that Onondaga Lake is just a polluted lake. Instead, people should know Onondaga Lake is the birthplace of democracy.”
The festival will include musicians (Abijah, Felicia Rose, Gypsy Red, April Love, Colleen Kattau, Marly Hornick, Over the Top, Blue CafÃ©, Ek-Kweh-Heh-Weh Singers, Ashley Cox, the Trichomes), speakers, storytelling (The Peacemaker Legend), local religious leaders, prayers for peace, earth conscious education programs, drum circles, youth theater, a Native American art exhibit, sacred dances, group singing, a water ceremony, and much more.
David Yarrow said; “We have added a lot to last year’s successful program. There is something for everyone.” Last year, the Onondaga County Parks Dept. estimated that 800-900 people attended the one day event.
“We are reaching out to heal the crisis of violence in our community and country. Onondaga is the place of peace, and the place where the Native American teacher known as the Peacemaker taught the Five Nations to ‘bury the hatchet’ to end war and killing.” Yarrow said. “It is that spirit of peace brought by the Peacemaker that we are looking to rekindle.”
“Take our musicians. This year, we have nationally known reggae singer Abijah and fm?id=19318, whose musical soul carries forth the one love legacy of Bob Marley. Abijah has a broad appeal with younger folks. We will also have Felicia Rose, a nationally known spiritual singer from Philadelphia,” Yarrow said.
When asked about the all venues, Yarrow brimmed with pride and winced. “At times we will have seven events occurring simultaneously. Which will be a challenge. But it will give people an opportunity to select and choose what they wish to experience. We will also begin each main stage performance with a prayer.” Yarrow said. The schedule appears below.
The third mission of the festival is to inspire and instruct about their path to bring peace to the world. Therefore, Sunday will be Next Generations Day, with a host of activities planned for young people. Emphasis will be upon education, storytelling and performances.
For participants looking for a more mystical experience at the festival, plenty will be had. Like last year, a peace pole will be set up to pray by, and a meditation tipi will be present. In addition to peace prayers, there will be a drum circle, chanting and group meditation, among other things. There will be several ceremonies as well during the festival. People will be encouraged to pray for peace with water, and reflect upon the importance of water in their lives. The prayer water collected will be poured into Onondaga Lake at the closing ceremonies on Monday.
The eclectic can also be found. World renowned expert on earth energies and former President of the Canadian Society of Dowsers Gary Skillen will will lecture and lead geological studies around the lake. Someone from the Finger Lakes Dowsers will give an introductory class to those wishing to learn how to dowse.
Friday night’s opening ceremony is free. Admission will be charged for the entertainment and education programs on Saturday and Sunday. One day admission is individuals $10, couples $15, families $20, youth $7. Two day prices are individuals $15, couples $25, families $30.
There are several events leading up to the festival. The public is welcome to join in on these events. We encourage participation.
