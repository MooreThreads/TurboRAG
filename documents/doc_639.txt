I was recently graced with a visit by a local ground squirrel who really enjoyed some sweet peas that just started bearing. The squirrel thought it was so good it ate everything I had, along with some parsley, kohlrabi, chard and more. That is not going to happen again.
This week, I have been building caged tables for seed starting as well as cages for the growing beds to house young plants until they are no longer appetizing to the local wildlife. Just the other day I seeded 15 flats of vegetables only to have them dug up by a little sparrow the minute I turned my back.
The seeding tables received their first residents today with the reseeded flats of Florence Fennel, Royal Oak Lettuce, Red Deer Tongue Lettuce and Bee Balm. I will be hand watering these until I get the automatic watering system in place.
Tomorrow I hope to start a new Biointensive compost pile by the nursery. I will include my first bed of compost crops that I will chop down tomorrow into the compost along with mature material and garden soil. I will discuss compost more thoroughly at a later time. The same bed that I took the compost crops from will be the same bed that I double dig, add some compost and amendments to, and transplant lettuce and direct seed radishes into. The first bed of the season.
