My peep has that book! She got it because it reminded her of Uncle Fergus. It's very cute!
what a great read and you two do look alike - love the double belly rubs - that was so cute
Fergus seems like a grreat guy! I wish he had a blog instead of just a book so we could talk to him.
Our mom was the Head Elementary School Librarian in the district she worked for... and she says that she used to read that book to her students... and they LOVED it... She had Several of Mr. Shannon's books in her schools.
Very good idea Daisy. More people should real books again and not on the computer

What a pawsome book to start your summer holidays with! We think you and Fergus could be twins...ok...twins from different mothers but the resemblance and traits are just remarkable, right? Mom LOVED summer holidays when she was a teacher - these would be in December for us - she would also spend her days reading books and catching up on her life. We look forward to the next book review.
