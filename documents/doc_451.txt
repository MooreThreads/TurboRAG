About the Course:
Forging a joint-venture is a means to leverage the skills, resources and relationships of the partners involved. In fact, many of the world's most successful companies were built on a foundation of a partnership between their founders. Examples include:
- Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak (Apple)
- Larry Page and Sergey Brin (Google)
- Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce (Intel)
- Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (Ben & Jerry's)
- Bill Gates and Paul Allen (Microsoft)
However, ill-conceived or ill-structured joint-ventures can lead to the implosion of the business, the loss of invested capital, the destruction of friendships and litigation. When crafting a joint-venture agreement the following are among the issues that should be crystalized:
- Legal entity
- Purpose and scope of the joint-venture
- Capital structure and capital contributions
- Governance
- Dealings between partners and joint-ventures
- Human resources
- Puts and calls
- Transferability of interests
- Dissolution / termination
This webinar provides guidance relative to questions such as:
- Is it prudent to operate the joint-venture as a trial before negotiating a joint-venture agreement?
- Should one lawyer be retained to negotiate the agreement with both partners?
- Should contributions of infrastructure be credited for equity or should fees for such contributions be received by the contributing party?
- How can joint-venture agreements be drafted to allow both parties to use assets of the JV for separate business interests independent of the JV?
- What are the risks for using a "shot gun" buyout mechanism for the less wealthy partner? What remedies are available to this partner?
- Which is more preferable to the selling partner - "rights of first offer" or "rights of first refusal"?
- What are event options and how should they be used in joint-venture agreements?
