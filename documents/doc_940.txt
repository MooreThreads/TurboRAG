With 2017 marking 10 years for this campaign launched by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), millions of people across the world will show their love and care for the planet by switching their lights off at 8:30 PM today for an hour. Earth Hour is the world’s biggest environment event and has one big agenda: to unite people to protect the planet and garner support for a low pollution and clean energy future.
Around the globe, millions of people, businesses and landmarks set aside an hour to host events, switch off their lights, and make noise for climate change action. This year Earth Hour is at 8:30pm on March 25, 2017. Shutting down lights for an hour wouldn’t reduce global warming but it will still make a little change and it’s always the small things that turn out to be huge! This is very important if we want a healthy life for all our next generations!
Earth Hour is the world’s largest movement for the environment, organised by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The idea is to encourage people to turn off their lights for 60 minutes in the evening. Initially, it started as a lights-off event in Sydney, Australia, in 2007. Since then, the event has grown to include 7000 cities and towns worldwide.
This event is completely voluntary and turning of your lights for an hour won’t make a huge impact right? WRONG!
