Pine Hill Online LD Tournament NCFL Topic
2018 â€” Online, PA/US
3 May 2018
Dear Fellow Coach,
On behalf of the Pine Hill Debate Squad, it is my pleasure to invite you and your team to our online Lincoln-Douglas Debate tournament, to take place on the weekend of May 19th and 20th, on the Zoom teleconferencing platform.
The hope is that this tournament will provide a timely opportunity for debaters who have qualified for the NCFL Grand National Tournament, to be held in Washington, DC the following weekend.
Please note that this tournament will have two distinctive features:
(a) We plan to have only competitors' coaches and/or Double-Ruby former LD debaters as judges. (To allow for meaningful feedback, fifteen minutes after each flight will be allocated for judges to offer post-decision feedback, either spoken or written on ballots.)
(b) Neither spreading nor semi-spreading will be allowed; debaters will be expected to deliver speeches at a natural speaking pace.
The competition will have one event--Lincoln Douglas Debate--on the NCFL Grand National Tournament resolution: "Resolved: Bystanders have a moral obligation to act in the face of injustice." There will be a maximum of 40 debaters, to be seeded according to total NFL points. The tournament will consist of four double-flighted preliminary rounds, as well as single-flighted semis, and a final round. There will be a single, open division, and NCFL rules will generally apply.
Registration will be managed at . You can also find more information at:.
Any changes after 5pm on 17 May should be emailed directly to jonathankendall@hotmail.com.
