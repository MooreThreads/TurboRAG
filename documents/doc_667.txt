From Strength to The World — The Hanged Man’s Path
Tarot’s Major Arcana is a map of the spiritual path on the physical plane from beginning to end. It shows all of the forces that come into play, all of the strengths and all of the pitfalls. It is a tool to allow the user to bring unconscious areas of the psyche into consciousness. It shows all of the duality in relevant detail and points at our Non-Dual Nature.
After we have had enough of repeatedly (Wheel of Fortune) pursuing numerous permutations of worldly experiences (arcana one through ten), have paid major karma (Justice) and have had some significant introspection (The Hermit); we may come to a turning point. A point of enough psychic cohesiveness to allow us to initiate a certain internal work to correct the mess we have gotten into psychologically, which has taken our natural peace away. Within that process, the state of readiness and intent to restore our Natural State of Peace is depicted on the arcanum “Strength”. We are now ready for the revelation of the The Hanged Man and the renewed spiritual perspective that ensues.
