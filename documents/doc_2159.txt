The Tweed Valley is situated in NSW on the Queensland border. The large bustling coastal centre of Tweed Heads is located right next to its twin Coolangatta. It is a centre of commerce and tourism with a variety of sporting, recreational and social clubs.
Being right on the Tweed River there are homes which have water access onto Boat Harbour and the canals just a stone’s throw from the centre of town. The Tweed Valley consists of 35kms of beaches and estuaries, small villages and headlands stretching from Fingal, Kingscliff, Bogangar, to the more remote Pottsville Beach further to the south, which has turned from a sleepy backwater to one of the fastest growing urban areas in the country. Current major Pottsville developments are Black Rocks by the Sea Estate, Koala Estate and Seabreaze Estate which includes. As of March 2007 the median price for a house in Tweed Heads currently sat at around 400,000 and a unit was going for approximately $300,000.
There are huge price increases predicted in the area for 2008, 2009 and 2010, and part of the reason for that is the value for money the area offers. Many visitors and investors are amazed at how low the local real estate prices are currently and feel assured that pending price rises will show handsome profits in the future. Developers too have been quick to react to the increasing population and accordingly there is billions of dollars worth of projects currently under way. This activity and excitement has the locals and visitors enjoying a buoyant economy. There has never been a better time to buy into the Tweed Heads real estate.
