- 100g (1/2 cup) caster sugar
- 75g (1/2 cup) gluten free plain flour
- 55g (1/2 cup) almond meal
- 45g (1/2 cup) desiccated coconut

- 215g (1 cup) caster sugar
- 1 lemon, rind finely grated
- 125ml (1/2 cup) fresh lemon juice
4 Method Steps
- Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan forced. Line a 16 x 26cm (base measurement) slice pan with baking paper, allowing the sides to overhang.
- Combine the sugar, flour, almond meal and coconut in a bowl. Add the melted butter and stir until well combined. Press firmly into prepared pan and smooth the surface. Bake for 15 minutes or until light golden.
- To make the filling, whisk the eggs, flour and sugar in a medium bowl until smooth. Whisk in the lemon rind and juice.
- Carefully pour filling over the base. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until filling is set. Set aside to cool completely in the pan before cutting into bars and dusting with icing sugar. Decorate with small lemon slices and piped whipped cream, if using.
