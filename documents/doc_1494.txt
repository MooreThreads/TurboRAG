************************************************************ POSTDOC POSITION at INRIA SOPHIA-ANTIPOLIS (MIMOSA team) ************************************************************ The MIMOSA team at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis is seeking candidates for a postdoctoral position, starting any time from January 2002, for a duration of one to three years. The position will be funded on the three-year project MIKADO, one of 13 "Global Computing" projects scheduled to start in January 2002 within the FET (Future Emerging Technologies) European programme, see the URL. The MIKADO project (Migration calculi based on domains) aims at establishing a programming model for secure mobile distributed computing on large-scale networks. It also intends to develop type systems and proof techniques associated with this model, as well as experiment with machine and language prototypes based on the model. The other partners of the project are INRIA Rhones-Alpes, France Telecom R&D, the Paris ENST, the University of Florence (with the University of Torino as associated site), the University of Lisbon and the University of Sussex. A close collaboration among the partners is expected, with two or more meetings every year. The INRIA Sophia Antipolis partner will address more specifically the study of process calculi including a notion of domain, and try to establish type systems and proof techniques for these calculi, with the aim of ensuring behavioural and security properties. The candidates are expected to have a good experience in some of the following areas: -Programming language semantics -Process calculi and related techniques -Mobile and distributed computing -Type Systems -Language-based security The net salary per month will be of 1740 EUR circa. Applicants should have a PhD or an equivalent research background. Applications (preferably by email) should include a full CV, a description of research interests, URL's for relevant publications, and contact details for a couple of referees. They should be sent as soon as possible to Gerard.Boudol@sophia.inria.fr Ilaria.Castellani@sophia.inria.fr The MIMOSA group at INRIA Sophia-Antipolis provides a friendly research environment, with an established expertise on process calculi for concurrency and mobility, type systems and a more recent interest in language-based security issues. For more details see the URL:. The geographical environment is extremely pleasant, INRIA being located in the Sophia-Antipolis scientific and technological park, in the middle of hills at some 10 km from Antibes and Cannes, and at a short distance (20min by car) from Nice international airport. The Cote d'Azur is mostly renowned for its beach resorts and film festival. It is also greatly appreciated by mountain and nature fans in general (there are plenty of beautiful walks to do all year round, from the neighbouring Esterel to the closeby Mercantour National Park, and quite a few ski resorts at a couple of hours drive). The climate is sunny and mild throughout the year, with some occasional (heavy) rain in the fall. Some knowledge of the french language will be helpful but is not required. French courses for foreign researchers are provided freely at INRIA at some periods of the year. For more details do not hesitate to contact us. ------------------------------------------------------------- Gerard Boudol and Ilaria Castellani INRIA, 2004 Route des Lucioles, BP 93, 06902 Sophia-Antipolis Cedex, FRANCE Tel.: +33 (0)4 92 38 79 40 (Gerard) +33 (0)4 92 38 76 40 (Ilaria) Fax: +33 (0)4 92 38 79 98 --------------81DC5E5903D989944E5DDA05--
