Ahh, I’ve been busy lately. So much for my goal of blogging more. I’m just about finished with the syncmyride.com website work I’ve been doing so I can go back to writing perl/php. Website stuff sucks. It was bad enough that I had to go back and start redesigning for each different browser. If only they all listened to the w3 standards… whatever.
So, I got a raise at work and my bonus… and then my car threw a rod. So, my old car is being sold for scraps and I picked myself up a 2008 Toyota Rav4. I wanted something with room in the back so I can move things at will, but still went easy on gas and was maneuverable. So far I really like this car.
I also turned 29 earlier this month. Tina gave me a really nice 22″ widescreen monitor. It’s surprising how much that changes everything. (Coming from my old 19″ crt.)
Anyway, I need to go get stridera.com back up…. been putting it off for too long and I need it to host the website we’re building for my final project for school.
Later
