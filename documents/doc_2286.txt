Bus Slættaratindur (880 metres) and Gráfelli (857 metres), the tallest mountains in the archipelago, located between the villages of Eiði and Gjógv.
A small road will lead you to Gjógv. You will be treated to gorgeous views when sliding down the valley. The coastal village is famous for its picturesque scenery dotted with colourful houses built around its sea-filled gorge that has given the village its name.
The gorge runs from the village into the ocean where you will also find a harbour. The landscape around the village is incredible and varied.
Gjógv means gorge in Faroese. It is a fitting name; the harbour carved by the sea was the village’s lifeline before the arrival of modern roads. From Gjógv you will have an epic view of the island Kalsoy.
This is a truly unique village and that is why it attracts visitors from abroad and locals alike, who are seduced by its untouched tranquillity. Gjógv is the perfect spot for a leisurely stroll, and you will enjoy the remote village before heading to its charming guesthouse, Gjáargarður, for hot drinks and pastries.
You will appreciate visiting Gjógv as you will feel the solitary lifestyle in the village and sense the untouched beauty. Imagine yourself living in this place, enjoying the valley and listening to the North Atlantic Ocean every morning. Gjógv will give you new perspectives on everyday life.
