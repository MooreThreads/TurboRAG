Joe Jackson Slams Doctor's Possible Suicide Defense
By PopEater Staff Posted Apr 5th 2010 10:10AM
"That's not true," family patriarch Joe Jackson told PopEater of the suicide report. "I don't think they will win with that. It's just not true!"
Jackson is "resting and relaxing" at the family's Encino compound, but he and at least a dozen members of the famous family will be there to face the doctor charged with causing Michael's death.
However, any circus-like event that may spring up Monday could be over before it starts.
The hearing itself will be a procedural one -- the main objective will be to assign a judge to try the case, in addition to setting a date for the preliminary hearing. If Murray attends, he won't be opening his mouth. Murray has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter.
When the trial does begin, the new defense strategy could prove problematic for prosecutors.
Sources tell the TMZ that Murray admits to giving Jackson a 25 mg dose of Propofol, enough to keep a patient asleep for only 10 minutes. The defense will reportedly claim that Ativan and Versed already present in MJ's system created a "synergistic effect" that put the singer to sleep for much longer.
It's when Murray left the room briefly, his lawyers will argue, that Jackson awoke and injected the remainder of a 20 ml bottle of Propofol into his IV. This injection caused a massive overdose that stopped his heart.
Joe Jackson is in the process of suing Murray, whom he also believes waited too long to get his son to the hospital.
"I want justice for my son, that's all I want, justice," Jackson told PopEater of his civil suit. "Dr. Murray needs to talk and tell everything he knows. All I want is justice for my son's death."

- can't even figure out why the doctor's guilt is in question. OF COURSE he did it. He ordered the drugs and administered them. That's premeditation if you or I did it. Can't stand Joe Jackson, but I agree with him on this one.

You are right... I think Joe needs to leave it alone, MJ did not like his Dad. It's all about money with Joe. I think MJ would not be happy with his Dad again... The man is a mean man. He was mean to him.. Leave it alone I say. MJ was on drugs.....Drugs do stupid things and he was not thinking right, quit with the Doctor. Thanks

Hey Joe, crawl under your rock. You sucked all the life out of Mike when he was alive now your trying to suck the embalming fluid out of him now. Your a worthless P.O.S.

Dr. Murray keeps changing his story. I realize that desperation has set in, but he put himself in this situation. He had a duty of care for his patient, and he was negligent. Whoever was giving Michael those I.V.'s, wasn't qualified to do so. Their lack of expertise is the reason why Michael's veins had collasped. I wish someone from Mike's inner circle would have loved him enough to INSIST that he get help for his insomnia. Even if that meant taking drastic measures, to get help for him.

I totally agree with Thebusylady. Where were his friends when he needed them.

I don't think he was a paedophile. Just a sad, naive, lonely human being, trying to relive the childhood he was never allowed to have.

Why are we still paying attention to this useless "human being?"

Mike - You don't have to pay attention if you don't want to. Useless trying to dissuade millions that want to though. Because we adore him. Always. King Of Pop. Wonderful humanitarian. I imagine most critics do nothing to change the world. Try to make it better. Or themselves. He will NEVER be forgotten.
shut up. you sound stupid and disturbed. I swear people like you WISH michael was a criminal to fufil some sick fantasy you haven. He was found not guily so there is NO proof he did snything wrong, why label and judge him like that. It is very ruse, you don't have to like the man but at least try to be respect of don't read about him or his family.

papa joe jackson has been living off his children's stardom since michael was on the sullivan show. but for all the money he;s gotten wasn't enough he looks like a lowlife he acts like a lowlife and he talks like a lowlife. the quotes about seeing justice done for his son sounds like he got help from jesse jackson or al show me the money sharpton. face it every one in the inner circle knows he was a junkie the same as elvis was. you can't have your doctor basically in your home almost 24/7. what joe jackson wants is to keep getting his name and his son's splattered on every tv show in america. before his death who ever wondered what jermian was doing or tito and also latoya was up to well we do know about latoya and her hot photos.the whole family has been touring telling everyone how much michael is missed i wonder how they felt about him being a pedifore. they'll all make as much as they can before america gets sick of them all

Joseph "living off" his children is no one's affair. Aside from Jacksons. I pray I live to care for my parents. Would be an honor. Michael is Joseph's son. Has a RIGHT to explanation as to untimely, and unnecessary death. Don't think he cares what people think. If he doesn't, I'd concur. No First Family Of Music minus him. Father in every, and any aspect you can imagine. So go ahead. Bash father. Bash son.

Addiction doesn't mean you deserve to die. If you die a "junkie", doesn't mean those who love and mourn you aren't entitled to some sort of an explanation. Physicians have an obligation to do what's in their patient's best interest. Always. NOTHING should change that.

Joe may have started the family on the path to music, but it was Michael's natural talent that blasted him into megastardom.
