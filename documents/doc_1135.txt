Preparation
In a heavy-bottomed stockpot or Dutch oven, heat butter and olive oil over moderate heat. Add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are light golden brown and translucent, 10 to 15 minutes.
Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their juices and start to turn golden brown at their edges. Add potatoes, parsley, salt and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes more to meld the flavors.
Add stock and bring the soup to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, partially covered, until potatoes are tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
Transfer soup to a blender or food processor and blend in batches until smooth (use caution when blending hot soup and be sure not to fill the blender more than half full). Return the soup to the pot, stir in cream and Worcestershire sauce. Adjust seasonings. Stir in half of the cheese just before serving.
Serve hot soup garnished with remaining cheese and chopped parsley.

Fantastic!
I made this last night. My family of 4 (3 boys) had only one complaint. I didn't make enough. My only modification to the recipe is that I retained about 2 cups of the soup (picking out the potatoes) prior to pureeing in the blender. My guys like to be able to chew on something in their soup. They aren't fans of purely cream soups, at least not as a main course. After pureeing the rest I returned the two cups of soup to the pot.
