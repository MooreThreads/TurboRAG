I think it is hilarious. Most of the country does not give a rip about stars that are delusional and hate rump why? What did the President do to them? Most normal american's will never go to their movies or support financially their careers or the studios or your theaters. You still take money to run your business' on right? Don't think your industry will never fail. Hollywood will become a ghost town in a few years. No tourists want tome to your city you all are acting like idiots and you sound delusional to average everyday people. We Americans are AWAKE and we have been researching all we hear to find the Truth evidence facts of every media story, we do not believe the msm either. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE YOU HATE AND LOATH US YOU THINK WE DO NOT HEAR AND SEE YOUR ACTIONS?????? You are delusional if you do not realize that. Funny an Industry where cameras and attention are on you 24-7 do you think it is still not on you now? We have been watching your wicked evil lying disgraceful behavior, we see you and all the famous acting like pure baffoons hating the American people outright. Did you forget we are the ones that finacially support your careers. What if no one came to your movies, listen to your music, come to your theme parks, bought your merchandise, #JustwalkedAway from Entertainment completely???? There are others ways a family can be entertained. We do not need to be abused by arrogant childish actors artists singers all others. What Disney did with Gunn - director Guardians of the Galaxy support child perversion and his sexual behavior that was it for me. I grew up in So Calif. I have done biz with musicians not anymore. I have moved out of the state closed my biz down do not ever want to engage with Hollywood on any level again.
