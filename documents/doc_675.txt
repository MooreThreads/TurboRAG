The CMA’s is upon us! November 8th 2017 we get to see our favorite country music stars and Icons. We get to hear our favorite songs AND we get to see some awesome red carpet looks. Today I decided to share my current top 4 Unique Western Boots with an emphasis on “unique“
My Top 4 Unique Western Boots
Women’s Ariat Farrah Over The Knee Boot
The ombre on this boot was the first feature to draw me in. The texture of the leather reminds me of a worn in boot which I LOVE. There is nothing better than your old worn in pair of boots. The craftsmanship and stitching around the sole are pure perfection.

Talk about a statement boot! The cut outs on the shaft are amazing and a rare find. I’ve never seen a boot like this or maybe I’ve just been under a rock. I adore the classic to and heel as well.
Women’s Golden Goose Young Western Boot
My goodness I can’t say enough about this boot. The gold cap toe obviously drew me in. The fact that it is a bootie is also a plus because I don’t have any like this one. The shape of the boot is quite classic but it’s really the toe that makes it amazing.

I am the camo queen around these parts! Mixing camo with a western boot is a recipe for PURE bliss. The texture and print on the toe is another layer that adds to the unique personality of this boot.
I can’t wait to share all of my favorite red carpet looks and performances! If you don’t already have a pair of western boots you should definitely get your hands on a pair! They are cute, comfy and versatile. Thank you for visiting!
