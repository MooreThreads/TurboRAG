INNER BEAUTY
The much beloved and read Maya Angelou past away this week at the age of 86. The world will remember her for her many fantastic books, but also for her short but true words of wisdom that she sprinkled over us throughout her life. Here are my favourite Maya Angelou quotes that I tend to stick to.
"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style."
"Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better do better."
"I´ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."
"It´s the fire in my eyes, the flash of my teeth, the swing in my waist, and the joy in my feet, I am a woman phenomenally."
R.I.P Maya Angelou.
