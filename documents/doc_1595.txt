Australian Moth Nationals
HOTLINK- KA Sails, and some of the sailors used to taking up places towards the back end were doing well to hang in with the leaders. Conditions ranged between 5 – 10 knots form the southwest.
Rob Gough came through with the win, with Andrew Mcdougall and James Owen-Smith taking second and third. In between races the fleet was battered by a rain squall and race eight started in 15-18 knots form the South-west. Again conditions were shifty and at times the breeze dropped to almost zero knots.
