Herbalife Bait & Switch Fraud: Sold Me One Commission Package Then Switched Me To A Lower One
Online Business Systems sold me a $4000.00 "Supervisor" commission pachage for $839.05 and after having me wire transfer the money to them, the switched me back down to the "Distributor" commission level. When I tried to find out who authorized the switch nobody would respond to my inquiries. All in all, they stole $1,397.95 from me. A word to the wise, don't have anything to do with this company. RUN, don't walk away from On Business Systems.
