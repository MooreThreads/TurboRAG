Telling students that I'm pumping? Would you?
Posted 8/19/14
I'm back to work tomorrow (teaching) for the first day of school. I've been planning to tell my older students (10th grade honors, pretty mature bunch) that I pump at lunch instead of keeping it a mystery why I have to kick them out. Not too many details, just that I'm pumping milk for the baby and that I'm not available. I figured it would normalize it, but I'm starting to worry that they won't take it well. What do you think? Would you inform them or not?
- I teach HS and I wouldn't tell my students. I don't want them to look at me like that or have to think about it. It might be awkward for the boys esp. I would just say they are going to eat in the lunch room this year.
- I would just tell them that you are unavailable, if they ask why I don't think it would be a problem but that's kind of a touchy subject with some people. I wouldn't tell my stidents I was going pee so I wouldn't tell them I was pumping either lol

Just tell them you are going to be unavailable to take care of a personal matter each day.
- rPosted 8/19/14I wouldn't tell them
- Posted 8/19/14Nope, it's none of thier business what you do on your lunch break.
- rPosted 8/19/14I agree with pp. This might make some of your students uncomfortable. I don't think it is your place to normalize in a high school setting especially outside the context of a class on that topic. I would just tell them you are unavailable. I have taught anatomy and physiology and I went over the functions for breasts but I still didn't volunteer what I was doing with my body and child. I think it is inappropriate.
- Posted 8/19/14No don't tell!
- waterdragonbaby Â· Original PosterPosted 8/19/14I guess I just hate feeling like it's a big dirty secret. I agree that some students might feel uncomfortable, so I won't bring it up. But if a student asks, I will explain. I know we have a different school environment than others, and students are used to teachers opening their rooms at lunch for clubs and conversation. I didn't tell my students when I pumped for DD, but they were 7th graders. I had a senior ask me at the end of last year why I was carrying a chair into the bathroom (long story, room share complications) and I told her I was pumping because I hate to be dishonest or evasive when a student asks a question. She wasn't uncomfortable, but I see how that's different than telling a whole class.
- I pumped last year and didn't tell them. Wasn't an issue.
- I told a couple of my teenage clients that I thought could handle it. inevitably all of my clients now know that when my office door is closed I'm pumping. It's become a whole awkward thing. I wouldn't tell, but expect them to figure it out anyways.
