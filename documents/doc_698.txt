FORMAT: DVD: Doctor Who - The Cybermen Box Set. Meanwhile the Cybermen coerce someone into doing their dirty work for them sending the Doctor, Stevens & Lester off to Voga strapped into booby trapped bombs. That's not going to end well. The idea that the Cybermen have been lured here by the ability to destroy a threat to them but it actually being a trap to destroy the Cybermen appeals to me. There's a couple of lovely touches with the transmat in this episode as the Doctor beams down playing with a yoyo and Sarah's doing something with her hands, actions that are continued from departure to destination giving a continuity even though one point was shot in studio and the other on location some weeks apart..
