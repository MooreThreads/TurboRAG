The Decision 2/97 of the EU Council became the basic legal act that promoted the idea of free movement of university students, teachers and educationalists between the EU (EC) Member States and the Czech Republic respectively.
Since then (what later became known as) the Erasmus+ Programme has evolved into the flagship of student academic mobility at the Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Law. Each academic year around 150 of our students leave Prague and approximately and even higher number of foreign students receives a welcome at our Faculty (about 200 students each year).
The Faculty of Law offers to its incoming Erasmus student the Program "Czech Legal System in European Context", which is taught completly in English. Foreign students coming to our Faculty of Law in the framework of other exchange programs than Erasmus+ (e.g. in the framework of the university exchange with overseas universities, etc.) can participate in the same program alongside the Erasmus students. This guarantees a very multicultural and interesting group of students that meets every year (semester) in the classes of the Czech Legal System in European Context Program.
