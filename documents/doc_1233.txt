The girls had the day off school today. For the life of me I can’t work out why the county closed the schools! I am used to an inch of snow closing the schools – this is Georgia after all, we don’t do snow. But today it was just icy, ok, it was very icy, but counties around us simply delayed school by two hours. Honestly, within an hour of the school start time, all the ice had melted and the weather was pretty warm! Crazy…..
Anyway, on with the recipes!
Seven Swans a Swimming…swimming in soup of course.
I give you homemade Swan Noodle Soup.
Makes 6 servings.
Prep:15 minutes, Cook:25 minutes
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 (48oz) box of chicken broth (stock)
3 cups shredded cooked swan*
1 cup egg noodles
1 large onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, crushed
2 medium carrots, sliced
salt and pepper to taste.
In a large heavy bottomed pot, bring broth to boil over medium high heat. Stir in chopped celery, swan, noodles, onion, garlic, and carrots. Boil for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes, or until noodles are done and vegetables are tender.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
* If swan is unavailable at your supermarket, you can substitute chicken.
Tonight we tackled eight maids a milking…not literally, no rugby in this house.
This is a very sweet very moorish milk punch! The girls loved it as it resembles closely a Macdonald’s shake. I halved the recipe for us, as Andy is still away working for Grinch Inc.
Milk Punch
Makes 12 to 16 servings
Prep: 15 minutes
1 gallon vanilla icecream. softened
1 cup bourbon or brandy (I just made the punch without the alcohol and then added a splash to my glass – perfect!)
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
In the container of an electric blender, combine half each of ice cream, bourbon, vanilla and cinnamon. Process until smooth. Remove from blender and pour into punch bowl. Repeat with remaining ice cream, bourbon, vanilla and cinnamon.
Easy and yummy!
