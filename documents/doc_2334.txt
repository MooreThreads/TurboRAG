3D-printing company Shapeways announced a new Custom Ring Creator app that allows anyone to create their own 3D-printed rings in minutes. You can personalize existing ring templates or customize a completely unique design of your own.
To create a ring, you just upload a black&white image and Shapeways' Custom Ring App will turns it into a 3D ring. You can then customize your 3D ring, set size and select the material. Once completed, Shapeways will manufacture your design and send your 3D printed ring to your home.
To make it easy for users, Shapeways have uploaded quite a few templates from designers that you can modify. The cost of rings ranges from $2.3 to $130, depending on the material you choose.
Below is a video that Peter Weijmarshausen, Shapeways CEO gave John Biggs an tour at the recent Shapeways expansion in Long Island City showing the process from order to shipment.
