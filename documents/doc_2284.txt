PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE: Perhaps Yogi Berra said it best when he uttered the phrase, "It's d√©j vu all over again." With Dr. Pandiscio asking me to fill in as interim principal this year, this phrase certainly hits home. I am appreciative of Dr. Pandiscio's faith in me and hope that I can help the high school, and especially the student body and faculty, to weather another year that will have its difficulties due to continuing construction. Students will have to share lockers again this year and we may have to move students and teachers more than once as new "old" parts of the building are scheduled for renovation.
The good news is that more of the "new" building will be ready for occupancy as the year moves along and the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel should get brighter and brighter. Except for punch-list items, this year should see the end of the reconstruction era and generations of Wachusett students can proudly look forward to receiving an education in a building that will truly be state of the art.
As for this year, there will be a full academic program and continued planning for the implementation of an upper and lower house system in 2007-08. As usual, a full range of athletic, drama, music and other student activities will be in abundance even though, while construction continues, some of these may have to be accomplished at "away" venues. We will all do our best to insure that the delivery of education and all it entails to the 1,900+ students who enter our door each morning is first rate.
