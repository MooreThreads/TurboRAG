Reports available here suggest that those offering prayers in the adjoining que at times use the space available with the gurdwara that was set up by Guru Ram Rai.
Former SGPC Secretary Kulwant Singh had written a letter to the External Affairs Ministry in October last year. The present secretary of the SGPC, Prof Gurbachan Singh, told TNS over the phone that the SGPC was yet to hear anything on this but there were reports of gurdwaras beings used as ques.
‘There is so much of commotion over Babri Masjid but the international community has not taken note of the formation of the PGPC which is headed by Javed Nasir which has taken control of Sikh shrines in Pakistan,’ Prof Gurbachan Singh said.
According to reports, the gurdwara building complex is spacious and during religious festivals like Id the congregation offering prayer spills on to the land in possession of the gurdwara. A board hangs outside the gurdwara relating to some social welfare trust, the reports said.
Apparently, many migrants from India had settled around the que which is situated close to the gurdwara set up by Guru Ram Rai as a place of worship. According to legend Guru Nanak Devji had paid a visit to the spot and washed his feet in the pool (choubachcha).
This gurdwara is not covered under the protocol between the two countries which allows Sikh delegations (jathas) to offer prayers in some of the historic shrines in Pakistan.
The SGPC has not been sending jathas to Pakistan ever since the formation of the PGPC last year in February. The SGPC has protested against the formation of the body headed by a person who has been the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence. While the SGPC has refrained from sending delegations, the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee which till recently was controlled by Mr Paramjit Singh Sarna, who belongs to the Tohra faction, had sent delegates to Pakistan earlier this year.
